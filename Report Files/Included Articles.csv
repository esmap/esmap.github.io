Moreover, sustainability and the functionality of alternative energy technologies remain unknown. The study aims to explore the socioeconomic constraints in the adoption and diffusion of biogas as alternative fuel for cooking in households in rural Pakistan and access the impact of biogas technology adoption on income, crop productivity and fuel consumption and drudgery. The study has also scrutinized the factors affecting the continuity of the biogas plants. Our analysis adds to the limited literature of adoption of biogas and the transition towards alternative fuel sources in the Global South. A multistage sampling procedure was used to collect data from 630 biogas adopters and non-adopters from three districts of Punjab. The empirical results from logit model and propensity score matching approach indicate that the older, wealthy farmers are more likely to adopt biogas technology. Cook's education, structure of house, location of kitchen and access to credit institutions also play positive role in this process. Poor operational methods, lack of maintenance and training facilities were the main reasons for the functional failure of existing plants and reason for the discontinuation. Moreover, biogas adoption has positive and significant impact on income and crop revenues and has negative impact on fuelwood expenditures and collection time. Due to the multidimensional nature of the problem, a comprehensive remedial approach addressing the socio-technical factors identified in the study and considering all stakeholders' cooperation could solve the existing lock-in situation in the ongoing implementation of biogas production and the transition towards alternative fuel sources.",101,,255-264

In the case of solar home systems, recent studies report positive socio-economic effects on households, but technology adoption remains underwhelming. In collaboration with a local solar technology provider, we conduct a randomized controlled trial in 75 large villages in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India to examine the ability of village solar demonstrations to create markets for solar home systems. We find no effect of such demonstrations on technology sales, awareness, or perceptions of solar technology. Technology adopters report high levels of satisfaction with product quality and service, suggesting that the null finding cannot be attributed to poor technology. These findings suggest that lack of awareness is not a binding constraint on the growth of solar technology markets in the study area. Based on additional surveys, we find evidence suggesting that access to credit from rural banks is an important explanation for variation in sales across villages. These results do not prove that information and awareness are irrelevant in general, but they show that even carefully designed marketing campaigns cannot increase demand for new products in the presence of a binding credit constraint.",109,,666-675

Households in Guatemala are gradually adopting liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves, but a strong tradition of woodstove use persists. We conducted a mixed-methods study of LPG stove use in peri-urban Guatemala. We used Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices surveys with 187 LPG stove owners who also used woodstoves to identify perceptions of stove and cooking practices. Barriers to sustained use of LPG stoves were evaluated through focus groups, participant observations with stove users, and key informant interviews with community leaders. Seven themes emerged that explain household decisions to use LPG stoves: (1) the ‚Äúnew technology‚Äù should be framed in terms of what the ‚Äúold technology‚Äù lacks, (2) income is not a predictor of gas stove acquisition but may predict sustained use, (3) men are key decision-makers but messages about LPG do not target them, (4) when stoves are viewed as ‚Äúprize possessions‚Äù they may not be used, (5) collective fear about gas stoves is not based on personal experience, but on ‚Äústories we hear‚Äù, (6) sustained LPG use is hampered by two major factors, seasonally available wood and LPG retailers who are perceived as dishonest, and (7) wood fuel collection is a time to enjoy the company of friends and family and is not ‚Äúdrudgery‚Äù. National policies should promote the use of clean cookstove technologies in peri-urban and rapidly urbanizing areas in Guatemala where LPG stoves are in use, but used intermittently, instead of the current plan to install 100,000 ‚Äúimproved‚Äù woodstoves by 2032. This could be done by improving dependable cylinder distribution services, targeting gas safety and promoting positive health messages that appeal to men, as well as women.",15,4,745-756

Improved stoves have been promoted by development actors since the 1970s to alleviate various environmental and health problems associated with biomass use, with largely disappointing outcomes. Against this background, this paper examines the intervention of an international development organisation ‚Äì Practical Action ‚Äì in West Kochieng, Kenya, where the organisation's energy poverty alleviation efforts are aimed at addressing the health hazards of biomass smoke with six ‚Äòlow-cost' improved cooking technologies. The study reveals that the cooking technology most valued by poor West Kochieng households is the one which most reflects their priorities, rather than those expressed by Practical Action. The findings point to three aspects of appropriateness of energy poverty alleviation interventions ‚Äì technological, economic and cultural ‚Äì which combine to influence acceptance and uptake of such interventions. The evidence highlights some of the limitations inherent in the generic policy recommendation to ‚Äòleapfrog' towards the resolution of energy poverty-related problems, and suggests that more measured steps which respond to the socio-economic realities of poor households are likely to engender more appropriate solutions.",47,,202-210

Climate change, the depletion of fossil fuels and the vulnerability of economies to resource speculation and unreliable political systems in the producing countries lay path for a broad implementation of smart alternative solutions. This means the integration of more sustainable renewable energy sources in the existing supply structures or the displacement of existing systems by new ones. Cities and communities are central players in the energy transition process. Energy demand is determined by the built environment. Renewable energy production needs space. The conflicts between different interest groups often break out in the context of local implementation measures that affect urban planning and the appearance of landscapes. Small- and medium-sized communities might prove to be game-changers in the overall energy transition because many problems have to be solved within their ambit. Urban planning is dealing with the numerous processes of urban change. Energy is a fairly new task to be addressed and many stakeholders lack experience and criteria for strategic decision making. After a period of fierce determination to turn the wheel against climate change, it seems that there is a growing resignation among politicians, planners and the public because some things have not turned out the way we'd expected and the hope for quick solutions fades. Rebound-effects seem to eat up the savings to a good extent, and alternative ideas of how sustainable energy systems may be put into place have not yet been persuasive in many cases. Energy systems have proved to be complex. They are still perceived to be important but in practice there is a growing uneasiness about the right steps to take. The overarching research question of this thesis is: What do decision makers in smalland medium-sized communities need to become more successful in implementing energy transition processes? For the research project this general question was broken down into four primary research questions: - How can communities anchor and monitor long-term energy transition visions in their communal development plans? - What tools and models are available for urban energy system analysis? - How can tools and models be adapted to the specific demands and boundary conditions in the case study communities to ensure long-term implementation of appropriate technologies and measures? - How does the practical implementation of the adapted tools work in the case study and what barriers must be overcome for long-term success? To answer these questions a combination of review of the current state of scientific literature of the thematic field with a practical application and evaluation of 'real' implementation projects was chosen. This appears to be a beneficial approach to scientific research in planning disciplines. The first research question is closely connected to urban planning and strategy. To anchor energy transition goals in these disciplines the potentials and consequences of political energy visions were studied. To monitor developments and progress existing indicator systems were reviewed and adapted to the needs of small- and medium-sized communities. For this overall target-definition the question of 'Exergy Thinking' in planning urban environments and energy systems was discussed. This basically means to create a deep understanding of the quality aspects in energy demand and supply systems and to be aware for better matching solutions. This approach opens many options for the integration of renewables in the heating and cooling supply. It showed that the definition of a clear long-term target or 'energy vision' supports the implementation of measures because it facilitates communication and controversy. The large number of available tools and scientific methods for the analysis and optimization of communal energy systems was reviewed to answer the second research question. The results from this work mainly led to the one central challenge that has to be solved whenever complex modelling and strategic decision making are affected: Data. Data describes the status-quo and gives necessary information on the complex system interactions and influence factors. The options to create a concise data framework for the central objective were addressed in two steps. From literature, existing models and approaches general data frameworks were collected and summarized. Since the method was to be applied to the test case study the data was validated and tested under the case study conditions. This showed deviations and necessary specifications but as well a good analogy to the default data. From this a transparent and adjustable spreadsheet-model was developed to create scenarios for the case study and to answer the fourth research question. To create a holistic picture of the communal energy system and the effects of increased exploitation of renewables geographic information systems (GIS) show very valuable functionalities. Especially since the processing and interpretation of geographic information is anchored in urban planning disciplines and creates an easy access if energy system information is integrated. The open data architecture of GIS allows the integration of different data types as long as they have a spatial correlation. This enables to retrieve valuable results from a scenario model even with rather fragmented and incomplete data. To show the effects of different implementation strategies represented by the different 'energy visions' three energy scenarios were run for the case study. These three scenarios represent central 'beliefs' or 'approaches' in energy transition as well as overall development indicators and specific local aspects. Therefore the success of energy transition measures remains limited if not all essential development parameters take a favorable course. The scenario evaluation shows some interesting results and shows the principal usability of the approach and the model. The base-case scenario shows that the community already reaches good results for the global energy indicators because of the existing measures. On a medium and long-term these measures are not sufficient though to stay on a good course. Especially the long-term developments in some cases produce unexpected results. For instance the rather unfavourable development of CO2-emissions in the renewable energies scenario was not a predictable result at first glance. Here the effects of the chosen technologies and the effects of superior developments show their impact. As well the huge impact of the assumed efficiency measures was somewhat unexpected. Even though the assumed refurbishment rates do not exceed national recommendations and the efficiency qualities are far from passive-house standard, the efficiency scenario shows the fastest and best results for the global environment indicators. This can be explained by the fact that the demand reduction optimally complements the existing renewable energy strategy and can show its full potential in this combination. The results of the smart-city scenario show the expected and desired trends of a moderate and balanced long-term strategy that leads to a slower but continuous positive development in all the analysed energy system indicators. The long-term trends of the scenarios and the effects of following 'plain' strategies can be visualised well with the model and the developed scheme. Therefore the initial research questions can be answered positively. The framework gives good and useful results and offers many options for future extension. Certainly the next and most important aspect to include into the framework is the question of costs and economic effects. The overall investment and operational costs for the measures in the different scenarios will be very different. Efficiency measures especially in the existing building stock are costly while the costs for PV-plants will most probably further decline. This is certainly a shortcoming for the efficiency scenario. A future study could as well look at overall economic effects of the diffe ent strategies for the benefit of the community. Basic figures on the economic effects of renewable energy systems are already available (Hirschl et al. 2010) and could be implemented. This would certainly make the framework more beneficial for communal stakeholders. The model is transparent and simple enough to go this way in the near future and the achieved results of this thesis project are a good basis for this. The realisation of energy systems as sketched in the smart cities scenario still demands some changes in the regulatory boundary conditions and some new technologies mainly in the information and communication technologies. Smart and electricity grid compatible buildings which can contribute services in grid stability are an issue still to come and contribute to the integration of renewable electricity. The integration of renewable heat in communal supply systems is a big future opportunity to realise LowEx potentials in the heating and cooling sector. Stakeholders in small- and medium-sized communities should be encouraged by the outcomes of the thesis to take initial steps on the energy transition path, since the results that can be reached with state-of-the-art technologies are very encouraging. Energy transition on a large scale depends on the local implementation. Despite the fact that public and scientific focus and attention is mostly on the megacities, it will be the countless small initiatives that will turn the tide.",5,,372 pp.

As well as displacing fossil fuel consumption by increasing renewable energy generation, projects are expected to have a range of social impacts which may result in additional positive sustainability outcomes. These include potential to increase: acceptance of renewable energy developments; awareness of renewable and sustainable energy technologies and issues; uptake of low carbon technologies; and sustainable/pro-environmental behaviours. To date however, there has been little investigation of whether and how these impacts occur. This paper presents results from qualitative research investigating the social impacts of a community woodfuel project as experienced by project participants and other local stakeholders. Findings show projects can raise awareness of renewable energy technologies and increase uptake of renewables. Overall the case study project successfully changed the local social context for development of woodfuel heating, reducing risk for all involved in the future development of this sector, particularly in the immediate locality. There was some evidence of increased engagement with wider sustainability issues but this was limited to direct participants, suggesting local projects need to be supported by wider systemic change to maximise impacts.",42,,239-247

Household air pollution is harmful to human health, climate, and environment. Sustained uptake and use of cleaner cooking technologies and fuels are proposed as solutions to this problem. In this paper, we present our study protocol aimed at understanding multiple interacting feedback mechanisms involved in the dynamic behavior between social, ecological, and technological systems driving sustained use or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies among the rural poor in India. Methods/Design: This study uses a comparative case study design to understand the dynamics of sustained use or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies and fuels in four rural communities of Rajasthan, India. The study adopts a community based system dynamics modeling approach. We describe our approach of using community based system dynamics with rural communities to delineate the feedback mechanisms involved in the uptake and sustainment of clean cooking technologies. We develop a reference mode with communities showing the trend over time of use or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies and fuels in these communities. Subsequently, the study develops a system dynamics model with communities to understand the complex sub-systems driving the behavior in these communities as reflected in the reference mode. We use group model building techniques to facilitate participation of relevant stakeholders in the four communities and elicit a narrative describing the feedback mechanisms underlying sustained adoption or abandonment of cleaner cooking technologies. Discussion: In understanding the dynamics of feedback mechanisms in the uptake and exclusive use of cleaner cooking systems, we increase the likelihood of dissemination and implementation of efficacious interventions into everyday settings to improve the health and wellbeing of women and children most affected by household air pollution. The challenge is not confined to developing robust technical solutions to reduce household air pollution and exposure to improve respiratory health, and prevent associated diseases. The bigger challenge is to disseminate and implement cleaner cooking technologies and fuels in the context of various social, behavioral, and economic constraints faced by poor households and communities.",15,70,

To address the problems of energy security, deforestation and pollution the government has developed a strategy (Masterplan) to increase use of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) as a cooking fuel from 12% to 58% by 2030. As a clean fuel scaled adoption of LPG has the potential to make significant positive impacts on population health. The LPG Adoption in Cameroon Evaluation (LACE) studies are assessing in the community (i) barriers and enablers for and (ii) local interventions to support, adoption and sustained use of LPG. A census survey conducted for LACE in rural and peri-urban regions of SW Cameroon provided an opportunity to investigate current fuel use patterns and factors associated with primary and exclusive use of LPG. A cross-sectional survey of 1577 households (1334 peri-urban and 243 rural) was conducted in March 2016 using standardised fuel use and household socio-demographic questions, administered by trained fieldworkers. Wood (40.7%) and LPG (51.1%) were the most frequently reported fuels, although the dominant fuels in rural and peri-urban communities were wood (81%) and LPG (58%) respectively. Fuel stacking was observed for the majority of LPG using households (91% of peri-urban and 99% of rural households). In rural homes, a higher level of education, access to sanitation and piped water and household wealth (income and asset ownership) were all significantly associated with LPG use (p < 0.05). In peri-urban homes, younger age, access to sanitation and piped water and increasing education were significantly associated with both any and exclusive use of LPG (p < 0.05). However, whilst household wealth was related to any LPG use, there was no relationship with exclusive use. Results from this census survey of a relatively well-established LPG market with lower levels of poverty and high levels of education than Cameroon as a whole, find LPG usage well below target levels set by the Cameroon government (58% by 2030). Fuel stacking is an issue for the majority of LPG using households. Whilst, as observed here, education, household wealth and socio-economic status are well recognised predictors of adoption and sustained use of clean modern fuels, it is important to consider factors across the whole LPG eco-system when developing policies to support their scaled expansion. A comprehensive approach is therefore required to ensure implementation of the Cameroon LPG Masterplan achieves its aspirational adoption target within its stated timeframe.",15,,729-743

This paper compares the household energy transitions in these nations through the analysis of both aggregate statistics and nationally representative household surveys. The two countries differ sharply in several respects. Residential energy consumption in China is twice that in India, in aggregate terms. In addition, Chinese households have almost universal access to electricity, while in India almost half of rural households and 10% of urban households still lack access. On aggregate, urban households in China also derive a larger share of their total energy from liquid fuels and grids (77%) as compared to urban Indian households (65%). Yet, at every income level, Indians derive a slightly larger fraction of their total household energy needs from liquid and grid sources of energy than Chinese with comparable incomes. Despite these differences, trends in energy use and the factors influencing a transition to modern energy in both nations are similar. Compared with rural households, urban households in both nations consume a disproportionately large share of commercial energy and are much further along in the transition to modern energy. However, total energy consumption in rural households exceeds that in urban households, because of a continued dependence on inefficient solid fuels, which contribute to over 85% of rural household energy needs in both countries. In addition to urbanisation, key drivers of the transition in both nations include income, energy prices, energy access and local fuel availability. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This could have the twin benefits of reduced impacts on human health and deforestation. The aim of this study is to better understand the barriers to the uptake of ethanol stove technologies by eliciting users' perception, adoption, and use patterns of ethanol stoves. The study was undertaken in Maputo, a city that was the focus of the first large-scale commercial ethanol stove project in Africa. A mixed-methods approach was adopted using both quantitative (N = 341 household interviews) and qualitative methods (5 focus group discussions, expert interviews). Ethanol stoves are currently used by about 17% of the surveyed households, while approximately 12% had discontinued its use and 71% never used it. While a large proportion of ethanol users compared the stove favourably against charcoal in terms of cooking time, convenience, cleanliness, and easiness to use, ethanol use seems to have diminished compared to charcoal. Ethanol seems to have replaced other clean cooking technologies such as electricity or LPG rather than charcoal. High ethanol fuel prices combined with low fuel quality and accessibility, as well as stove malfunctions due to poor design influenced many ethanol stove adopters to quit it. For the effective uptake of ethanol, it will be necessary to address the factors that tend to discourage its use, particularly its high initial and operational cost, poor fuel quality, unreliable fuel supply, and poor stove design. Although clean cooking fuels might not be attractive to users due to affordability and failure to meet user preferences, awareness raising campaigns that target potential users should emphasise the associated health and safety benefits of clean cooking fuels. ¬© 2018 International Energy Initiative",44,,97-108

Although now largely discredited, this assumption remains a foundation of laissez-faire policies that anticipate energy transition resulting spontaneous forest recovery with economic development. Our results suggest that such policies can undermine broader policy objectives and actually worsen forest conditions in rural Indonesia. Based on a case study of forest margin communities in eastern Indonesia, we demonstrate that fuel subsidy reform did little to reduce rural household demand for fuelwood, while dramatically increasing fuelwood demand for processing agricultural products. Our results show how household decisions related to fuel sources are affected by non-economic considerations and external factors, such as opportunities to sell fuelwood. We argue that policy interventions that encourage energy transition of households do not necessarily improve forest conditions, as household fuelwood use may be a symptom, rather than a driver of deforestation and forest degradation. Thus policies to improve forest conditions should focus more on addressing the market environment of forest-margin communities, providing energy alternatives to small industries that are often the larger consumers of fuelwood.

The use of biomass in inefficient ways in rural areas increases fuelwood demand of a household. Development of the improved biomass stove programs in the 1970s has been one of the efforts to reduce burden on biomass resource base through reliable and efficient methods of energy consumption. However, despite having multiple economic, social, environmental, and health benefits; the improved stove dissemination programs failed to capture worldwide recognition. A wide array of socio-cultural, economic, political, and institutional barriers contributes to the low adoption rate of such programs. Drawing on field work surveys in rural northwest Pakistan, this paper provides empirical evidence of individual, household, and community level variables that play a vital role in the adoption of improved cookstoves. The study is based on primary data collected from 100 randomly selected households in two villages of rural northwest Pakistan. Using regression analysis, the study depicts that education and household income are the most significant factors that determine a household willingness to adopt improved biomass stoves. The study concludes that the rate of adoption could substantially be improved if the government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a greater role in overcoming the social, economic, cultural, political, and institutional barriers to adopting improved cooking technologies. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Willingness to adopt improved cookstoves in Malawi,Energy Policy,0301-4215,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.02.034,"Malawi has set a target of adoption of two million improved cookstoves (ICS) by 2020. Meeting this objective requires knowledge about determinants of adoption, particularly in rural areas where the cost of traditional cooking technologies and fuels are non-monetary, and where people have limited capacity to purchase an ICS. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with 383 households in rural Malawi asking them if they would chose a locally made ICS or a package of sugar and salt of roughly equal value. Six months later, we assessed adoption and stove use patterns. Sixty-six percent of households chose the ICS. We find that having a larger share of crop residues in household fuel supply, awareness of the environmental impacts of woodfuel reliance, time the primary cook devotes to collecting fuelwood, and peer effects at the village-level increase the odds of choosing the ICS. Having a large labor supply for fuelwood collection and experience with a non-traditional cooking technology decreased the odds of choosing the ICS. In a rapid assessment six months after stoves were distributed, we found 80% of households were still using the ICS, but not exclusively. Our findings suggest considerable potential for wide-scale adoption of low cost ICS in Malawi.",92,,409-419

Despite the promise of improved cookstoves to reduce these impacts, adoption rates are relatively low. Using a 2-wave sample of 144 households from the baseline and first midline of an ongoing 4-year randomized controlled trial in Rwanda, we analyze the drivers and associations of early adoption of a household energy intervention marketed by a private sector firm. Households sign an annual contract to purchase sustainably produced biomass pellets and lease a fan micro-gasification cookstove with verified emissions reductions in laboratory settings. Using difference-in-differences and fixed effects estimation techniques, we examine the association between take-up of the improved cooking system and household fuel expenditures, health outcomes, and time use for primary cooks. Thirty percent of households adopted the pellet and improved cookstove system. Adopting households had more assets, lower per capita total expenditures and cooking fuel expenditures, and higher per capita hygiene expenditures. Households with married household heads and female cooks were significantly more likely to adopt. Adjusting for confounders, we find significant reduction in primary cooks' systolic blood pressure, self-reported prevalence of shortness of breath, an indicator of respiratory illness, time spent cooking, and household expenditures on charcoal. Our findings have implications for marketing of future clean fuel and improved cookstove programs in urban settings or where stoves and fuel are purchased. Analysis of follow-up surveys will allow for estimation of long-term impacts of adoption of interventions involving pellets and fan micro-gasification cookstoves. ¬© 2019, EcoHealth Alliance.",16,1,Jul-20

Proceedings",,,"Domestic energy insecurity is a major threat to sustainable development in a developing country like Bangladesh. The present study aimed at estimating the factors that affect adoption of biogas plant and analysing the factors responsible for the improvement of livelihoods of the biogas users. The study was based on primary data collected from randomly chosen 50 biogas user households and 30 non users in Ghatail and Fulbaria upazilas (sub district) of Tangail and Mymensingh district respectively. Required data were collected adopting direct farm survey method during January to February, 2015. Binary logistic regression model was used to analyse the data. The findings of the study reveal that education, income, farm size, number of cattle and cost of fuel were positively associated with the adoption of biogas technology. The major findings of the logistic regression showed that respondents having education over 8 years had 20.78 times more possibility of adopting biogas technology than tthose who had education less than 8 years of schooling. The probability of adopting biogas plant by a household owning land above 0.60 hactare was 7.31 times higher than those households owning land less than 0.60 hactare. The results of the logistic regression model fitted for livelihood improvement revealed that a biogas user who supplied gas to other consumer is 11.66 times more likely to achieve moderate improvement in livelihood than the user who could not supply gas to other consumer. The findings also showed that environmental and econmic factors were the two vital factors influencing the adoption of biogas. This study highlighted on the strategies such as organizing training, publicity program, motivational activities on biogas technology; encourage more educated people to adopt biogas technology and expanding subsidy and loan provision, extending period of loan repayment to increase the likelihood of adopting biogas plants.",,,1642-1661

In Switzerland, photovoltaic (PV) electricity is seen to play a major role in the future. Stakeholders' opinions in the implementation of photovoltaic projects may block or delay the achievement of renewable policy goals. This paper explores the question: which are the main drivers and risks perceived by stakeholders at different levels of the government in the implementation of a pilot PV project? Methods: We study a decision-making process of a pilot project in the Swiss Alps to figure out which determinants explain the public opposition to such implementation. We study five types of determinants of public acceptance: economy, technology, environment, social aspects, and the policy process. We use Q methodology, which is especially suited to determine the different interests of stakeholders' groups. Results: Our results show four different perspectives: ""Mainstream proponents,"" ""Ecologically wary,"" ""Worried about implementation,"" and ""Looking for cantonal and national backing."" The results indicate that the photovoltaics' acceptance was highly driven by the potential contribution of the project to the regional economy. However, economy and technology determinants elicited both the highest and the lowest statistical consensus among perspectives (z-score). Our results point out the important role of initiators to maintain trust during the decision-making process. Finally, stakeholders in the photovoltaic project wanted to have fluent access to concrete information about the project and its future plans. Conclusions: Most of the implementation risks observed are determinants of acceptance related to economic aspects and the policy process. Characteristics of the decision-making process, such as trust during the process, affect the perceived outcomes of the project. Aspects of the decision-making process may, therefore, turn into risks for the project's implementation. Results also suggest that techno-economic assessments are key drivers to fostering energy transitions, but they are not sufficient in themselves. Initiators have to consider enhancing communication since the early steps of the policy process, the intelligence and promotion phases to avoid implementation risks.",8,,

Methods: A qualitative study with an ethnographic perspective was conducted in 2013/2014 based on 62 interviews with women who had participated in an improved firewood cookstove program in 2005. Thematic qualitative content analysis was performed. Results: Very few women from the indigenous communities were using the improved cookstove at the time of the study; the majority had dismantled or had ceased using it; whereas most of those from the mestizo community were using it for all of their cooking activities. In the indigenous communities, characterized by extended families, uptake of new technology was limited by traditional routine practices, rearrangement of rooms in the house, attachment to the traditional stove, a low- or non-risk perception of woodsmoke; gender relations, insufficient training, non-compliance with program recommendations and design-related aspects. Conversely, in the mestizo community, the uptake of the improved cookstove was favored by routine cooking practices in a nuclear family, a previous use of a raised cookstove and social representations on the health-disease-death effects of woodsmoke vs. the health benefits of cooking with improved stoves. The sociocultural dimension of communities and the cookstove design are aspects that either favor or limit the use of improved cookstoves in indigenous and mestizo populations. Conclusions: Effective cookstove programs must take these elements into account from their early planning stages, and blend them into implementation and follow-up. Project communication, training and differentiated follow-up activities ensuring the operation and maintenance of the cookstove, should be designed according to the specific needs and traditions of each community; they should be based on the preferences and needs of the users.",13,2,e0193238

Likewise, the shift from firewood to electricity as a primary cooking fuel was observed in only 5% of the households studied. Country level analysis indicates that rural households falling in lower monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) classes have lesser access to electricity and clean cooking options than those falling in higher MPCE classes. Again, only three states in India with high levels of rural household electrification report consumption statuses more than 82kWh per month (the estimated mean for electricity consumption by induction stoves).

There was also a 10 percent reduction in the number of households using firewood. This paper investigates LPG adoption by households who previously relied on kerosene and firewood from two perspectives: the institutional perspective, and social acceptance. Semi-structured interviews with representatives from central government to local government in addition to members of the public in six regions in Java and Sumatera were conducted. Findings indicate that the central government's commitment to implement the substitution policy‚Äîalongside effective regulatory instruments, financial support and infrastructure‚Äîwas critical to the success of the policy. Meanwhile, from a household perspective the reasons behind adoption of LPG were favourable prices, as the result of subsidies and incentives; energy market lock-in; social trust and norms; government communication and campaigns; and favourable appliance characteristics and/or kitchen design. However, there were also LPG resisters who maintained the use of firewood rather than adopting LPG. Safety concerns, cooking preferences and habitual practices were identified as the main determinants of LPG resistance. Understanding the reasons underlying cleaner fuel acceptance or resistance is essential for policy makers to determine successful regulatory pathways to improve fuel quality for better quality of life.",58,,101248

Against this background, we evaluate the impact of a large government program to substitute LPG for kerosene in Indonesia. Using a household survey across urban, suburban and rural regions we find that this program was very effective in causing a large scale shift from kerosene to LPG. This shift was positively influenced by level of education, household size and household income. Contradicting the energy-ladder model, the LPG program, reinforced by an increase in the price of kerosene, led to increased stacking of fuels, including increasing consumption of both electricity and traditional biomass. In addition, our analysis shows that the LPG program failed to substantially reduce the overall number of energy-poor people, but it has been effective in alleviating extreme energy-poverty. Finally, we find that medium and higher income households in suburban areas benefitted most from the LPG program.",66,,436-449

Little is known about adoption and use of such systems from the users’ perspective. Methods - We explored the facilitators and barriers to adoption and use of a private sector marketed household cooking energy system that uses sustainably produced biomass pellets and the cleanest burning fan micro-gasification stove currently available. We conducted 48 in-depth qualitative interviews in Gisenyi, Rwanda with decision-makers and cooks in 16 households that adopted the improved cookstove system and 8 non-adopter households. Results - Reported facilitators and barriers to adoption and non-adoption, as well as use and non-use were complex, and in some cases, contradictory. Some adopters noted that cleanliness and low smoke production were major facilitators to adoption and use, while other adopters and non-adopters said the cookstoves blackened and damaged cooking pots and produced excessive smoke. Our findings suggest that correct use of the stove mediates user experience. Cost was likewise reported as a facilitator among some adopters and a barrier among other adopters and non-adopters. Peer influence played a significant role as both a barrier and a facilitator to adoption and transcended other factors. Positive peer influence describing the cleanliness, affordability, and efficiency of the cookstove system encouraged adoption and use, while negative comments by peers regarding excessive smoke and damaged cooking pots discouraged adoption. Commentaries by some participants suggest that inadequate training and instruction may be primary causes of the discrepancies. Conclusion - Cost, cleanliness, communication among peer networks, and adequate training and instruction are important factors associated with the adoption and use of improved cookstoves and should be prioritized in the implementation of improved cookstove programs.",13,10,e0203775

The aim of the RLP is to contribute to Ghana's overarching goal to provide LPG access to 50% of Ghana's population by 2020. The RLP has not announced long-term program objectives. However, in the interim the RLP targeted a cumulative total of 170,000 LPG cookstoves to rural households by the end of 2017.

Consumers purchase locally produced biomass pellets and receive the improved cookstove on a lease basis. The cost of the pellets and stove(s) is lower than the cost of cooking with charcoal in the urban setting where our study takes place. Inyenyeri has been piloting its business model since 2012. Using data from an ongoing quantitative impact evaluation study, focus group discussions, and a series of key informant interviews, we chronicle the firm's experience with stove choice, pellet production, and marketing, highlighting lessons for the design of private sector-led clean cooking interventions. We find that 38% of households marketed to as part of our ongoing impact evaluation study adopted the pellet and stove system, but that approximately 45% of those who adopted suspended contracts after signing up. The firm's experience with stove choice, pellet production, pricing structures, and customer service strategies have influenced implementation, adoption rates, and scale-up. Customer preferences for specific stove attributes and willingness of stove manufacturers to modify stoves for local conditions have influenced both the firm's choice of stove and customer satisfaction. In 2015 the firm transitioned customers from the Philips stove to the Mimi Moto, a decision which created confusion among consumers, and affected adoption rates. Despite the challenge of establishing and scaling-up pellet production in central Africa, the firm increased production 400% between 2014 and 2017 to reach 800,000‚ÄØkg/year. Importing and maintaining pelletizing equipment in Rwanda is costly, the supply of feedstock irregualar, and undercapitalization of the firm have affected production. With respect to marketing, after experimenting with a sign-up fee and a minimum monthly purchase of pellets, the firm has decided to transition to a pay-as-you-go system to reduce perceived risk by consumers. A high-level of customer service including in-home visits, free in-home repair, and home delivery of pellets are major innovations. The long pilot phase and the evolutionary nature of the firm's activities illustrate both the complexity of building a market for clean cooking, and the time required to understand nascent markets and consumer demand.",46,,32-41

This was primarily motivated by the rising cost of kerosene subsidies. Objective To review the national conversion program and LPG scale up by evaluating its impacts, including assessing sustained changes in cooking behaviour and consequent reductions in exposure to household air pollution (HAP). Methods and data sources Searches of peer-review and grey literature in both English and Bahasa Indonesian were conducted and supplemented by interviews with key informants, data from the National Statistics Agency and results from household surveys. The data were extracted and analyzed using an Implementation Science approach. Results The main kerosene to LPG conversion phase took place in highly populated kerosene dependent areas between 2007 and 2012 reaching over 50 million households, approximately two thirds of all households in Indonesia. Since then the drive to expand LPG use has continued at a slower pace, especially in more remote provinces where solid fuel is more widely used. Over 57 million LPG start up kits were distributed as of 2015. Beginning in 2018, the open subsidy for LPG is expected to be replaced by one targeted at lower income households. While the main conversion phase has been highlighted as an example of effective and impressively fast fuel switching at scale, the impact on domestic biomass use remains limited. Conclusions Addressing HAP and the health impacts associated with kerosene and biomass use was never an objective of the program. Consequently, there is limited evidence of impact in this area, and in hindsight, missed opportunities in terms of influencing cooking behaviour change among biomass users, who are more at risk.",46,,71-81

With a few exceptions, large government and charitable programs to distribute advanced stoves have not had the desired impact. Commercially-based distributions that seek cost recovery and even profits might plausibly do better, both because they encourage distributors to supply and promote products that people want and because they are based around properly-incentivized supply chains that could more be scalable, sustainable, and replicable. The sale in India of over 400,000 ""Oorja"" stoves to households from 2006 onwards represents the largest commercially-based distribution of a gasification-type advanced biomass stove. BP's Emerging Consumer Markets (ECM) division and then successor company First Energy sold this stove and the pelletized biomass fuel on which it operates. We assess the success of this effort and the role its commercial aspect played in outcomes using a survey of 998 households in areas of Maharashtra and Karnataka where the stove was sold as well as detailed interviews with BP and First Energy staff. Statistical models based on this data indicate that Oorja purchase rates were significantly influenced by the intensity of Oorja marketing in a region as well as by pre-existing stove mix among households. The highest rate of adoption came from LPG-using households for which Oorja's pelletized biomass fuel reduced costs. Smoke- and health-related messages from Oorja marketing did not significantly influence the purchase decision, although they did appear to affect household perceptions about smoke. By the time of our survey, only 9% of households that purchased Oorja were still using the stove, the result in large part of difficulties First Energy encountered in developing a viable supply chain around low-cost procurement of ""agricultural waste"" to make pellets. The business orientation of First Energy allowed the company to pivot rapidly to commercial customers when the household market encountered difficulties. The business background of managers also facilitated the initial marketing and distribution efforts that allowed the stove distribution to reach scale.",19,,138-150

Currently, this coal‚Äêdependent province has launched the Hebei Air Pollution Prevention and Control Program to curb air pollution by replacing residential coal consumption with natural gas and electricity for space heating in winter. Approximately 2.53 million households have completed the switch from coal‚Äêburning stoves to natural gas or electricity stoves in rural areas surrounding Beijing and Tianjin since 2017. However, the contribution of this clean heating replacement on provincial emission reduction remains unclear. This study aimed to determine emission factors, energy efficiency, and economic profits of traditional coal‚Äêburning stoves, as well as cleaner natural gas and electricity stoves by laboratory simulation and field tests. The results indicated a significant reduction after clean replacement for PM2.5, CO, CO2, NOX, SO2, CH4, and 16 types of U.S. EPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The emission of PM2.5 can be reduced by 99% and 95% for natural gas and electricity switch. Toxic equivalent quantity value of PAHs was also decreased from 4.89 (coal) to 0.03 (natural gas) and 0.07 Œºg/MJnet (electricity). When comprehensively considering the upstream pollutants emissions from power plant, natural gas switching performed better than coal‚Äêfired electricity. Moreover, the government supported the clean heating replacement project with extensive financial subsidy for purchasing clean stoves and using clean energy within 3 years in rural areas. A relatively cheaper price on an energy basic of natural gas and electricity use can be obtained after this subsidy compared to coal.",7,,120-131

ABPP was established in 2009 to promote adoption of biodigesters by rural households in sub-Saharan Africa. We use the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation, Adoption, Maintenance) with information from literature, internal documents, primary data from user surveys and interviews with sector stakeholders. ABPP was implemented with the primary objective of establishing viable biodigester markets. By 2017, Kenya made most progress toward commercial viability, evidenced by market entry of companies offering prefabricated digesters and establishment of 22 marketing hubs, which link rural organizations with local construction enterprises and finance institutions. In Uganda 5 marketing hubs were established and in Tanzania 7. Between 2009 and 2017 over 27,000 households installed a biodigester, half of them in Kenya. Additional objectives include improving agricultural productivity by using bioslurry, improving health, reducing deforestation, and improving livelihoods. Households perceive higher crop yields (84%-91% of users), reduced fuel consumption (84%-94% of users), reduced eye problems and respiratory symptoms (45%-91% of users). Benefits most appreciated are ""easy cooking"" and ""saving time and money"". Fuel consumption tests show households with biodigesters use 2.1 to 3.3 fewer tons of wood per year than similar households without biodigesters. The ABPP case study suggests that the program has created a nascent biodigester market in East Africa. The country programs have been dynamic and adaptive, moving along the cycle of market development; however, many challenges remain. For example, while half of the adopters in Kenya exclusively use biogas for cooking, in Uganda and Tanzania fuel stacking is more prevalent, making it more difficult to achieve health and environmental objectives. In addition, high upfront cost, limited access to credit, and lack of maintenance present challenges. In 2016, 27% of biodigesters constructed between 2009 and 2013 were not working. In response, ABPP implemented call centers and launched campaigns to repair non-functioning plants. To ensure long-term viability and increase the likelihood of achieving environmental and health goals, we suggest deeper engagement with governmental and non-governmental stakeholders and a targeted campaign promoting exclusive use.",46,,23-31

Due to the large fiscal burden of the LPG subsidy, increases in electricity from hydropower, and other socio-political factors, the Government of Ecuador has launched a major induction stove program (PEC) to reduce the demand for LPG. We assess the effects of the LPG subsidies and PEC using government records, interviews, academic literature, newspaper reports, household surveys, and focus groups. Household surveys, conducted in rural, northern Ecuadorian households (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ383), characterized cooking patterns and fuel access. Focus groups (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ6) were carried out with a subset of surveyed households to better characterize survey findings. The LPG subsidy was developed as part of broad social support reforms in the early 1970s, without specific aims to reduce the health impacts of household air pollution from woodfuel or provide economic benefits as part of the transition to a clean cooking fuel. Nonetheless, the subsidy has resulted in nearly all Ecuadorian households cooking primarily with LPG. PEC has generated the sale of 740,000 induction stoves since its inception in 2014, short of the goal of 3.5 million. Among the rural households surveyed, LPG use, acceptance, and satisfaction was high, however, more than three-quarters of those surveyed reported weekly woodfuel use. Induction stove ownership (17%) and use as a primary cooking fuel (1%) was low among the rural households surveyed; furthermore, households owning induction stoves reported very low satisfaction with the stoves. Here we show that nationally-representative surveys reporting only ‚Äúprimary cooking fuel‚Äù use may underestimate solid fuel use as a supplemental household cooking energy, particularly in rural areas where fuel availability issues play a stronger role in decisions about what fuels to use.",46,,111-122

We find consistent evidence across both analyses suggesting that the women in rural Bangladesh do not perceive indoor air pollution as a significant health hazard, prioritize other basic developmental needs over nontraditional cookstoves, and overwhelmingly rely on a free traditional cookstove technology and are therefore not willing to pay much for a new nontraditional cookstove. Efforts to improve health and abate environmental harm by promoting nontraditional cookstoves may be more successful by designing and disseminating nontraditional cookstoves with features valued more highly by users, such as reduction of operating costs, even when those features are not directly related to the cookstovesâ€™ health and environmental impacts.",109,27,10815-10820

The intervention lacks formal marketing, but has spread across a wide area in just a few years. To understand the process, we map the social network of active community members who drove diffusion across a large swath of the country. We find that most ACMs heard about stoves twice before sharing information about it with others and introducing the stove into their own communities. On average, the social distance between ACMs and the project team is 3 degrees of separation. Both men and women are critical to the diffusion process, but men tend to communicate over longer distances, while women principally communicate over shorter distances.

The method of investigation applied graphical, contingency tabulation and discrete choice analyses to data drawn from the recently conducted Household Health Survey. The results show that traditional solid biomass dominates the fuel-portfolio with two third of the population using smokier fuels and that deforestation and health risks, especially among small children, are the key associated externalities. It is also found that, asset poverty, low educational achievement, and female headship of households are important factors retarding the adoption of clean fuels. Other householdâ€™s demographic characteristics as well as status and location of the dwelling unit also robustly influence fuel choices. Policymakers need to account for these factors in the design of action plans aiming to scale up access to clean and green fuels. The findings imply that taxing smokier fuels might not be equitable; however, a tax on selected biomass fuels and other measures could be administered to regulate biomass consumption, increase its production and improve the efficiency of its utilization with reduced risks. In addition, policies aiming at raising income and improving education would smooth the transition to modern fuels.",,,Working Papers

Drawing on a pilot-scale experiment conducted in rural Cambodia, this study evaluates whether economic incentives enhance continued use ofâ€”and fuel savings fromâ€”improved cookstoves (ICS). Capital-cost subsidies that have been traditionally employed to enhance ICS adoption were augmented with rebates linked to stated and objectively measured use in order to investigate impacts on both initial and sustained adoption in the treatment group. Results show that households do respond to these rebates by adopting the intervention ICS at significantly higher rates, and by using it more frequently and for longer periods. Consistent with these stove-use patterns, solid-fuel use and time spent collecting or preparing fuels also decline. However, this effect appears to diminish over time. Thus, while economic inducements may significantly increase adoption and use of new environmental health technologies, corresponding reductions in environmental or livelihood burdens are not guaranteed. Additional research on the design and implementation of incentive-based interventions targeting households directlyâ€”such as carbon financing or other forms of results-based financing (RBF) for improved cookstovesâ€”therefore seems warranted prior to wider implementation of such solutions.",12,3,35009

In order to exploit the potential of improved cookstoves for sustainable development, various governmental and non-governmental initiatives have for decades tried to convince households in the developing world to change their behaviour and adopt the new technology. These have had very limited success. This study turns to the often overlooked but important role of social relations for individual behavioural change and examines the question of how, and how far, behaviour change techniques (BCTs) can promote adoption of improved cookstoves. Based on previous theoretical and empirical insights, the study assumes that social relations have great influence on the diffusion and adoption of new innovations. To answer the research question, the study compared improved cookstove users who acquired improved biomass-powered stoves from two different implementers, using a survey that included an egocentric social network analysis. The study findings suggest that the implementer who provided ongoing post-sales contact and support, and who marketed the stoves to existing social groups with a high level of shared identity, achieved much higher levels of adoption.The results also suggest that BCTs can be used to create a social multiplier effect, with improved cookstove users recruiting new users.

However, a new class of advanced cookstoves equipped with thermoelectric generators could improve both emissions performance and adoption leading to better health outcomes. These cookstoves use electrical power provided by a thermoelectric generator to power combustion-improving fans while powering outboard USB charging ports. In communities lacking electricity access, USB levels of power could provide much-needed off-grid charging for mobile phones, small lights, and other loads. However, there is a risk that instead of being used primarily as a cooking tool, these cookstoves could be used solely as fire-powered USB chargers. Without displacing traditional cookstoves, â€œcharging-onlyâ€� adoption would result in a net increase in emissions exposure. In this study, we used custom Advanced Stove Use Monitor (ASUM) sensors to measure adoption of TEG-equipped cookstoves in 72 rural homes without electricity access in Odisha, India. To measure the impacts of the USB charging port, we randomized whether recipients received a cookstove with USB ports enabled or disabled. We found that access to USB charging ports significant increased adoption of cookstoves in â€œcookingâ€� use modes; USB-enabled cookstoves were used for cooking 3.5X more than identical cookstoves with disabled USB ports. This substantial increase in cooking came with a relatively small marginal use of the cookstove in a â€œcharging-onlyâ€� mode; just 11% of total cookstove use was in this mode. As with past work, data showed that surveys of user behavior do not correlate well with sensor-measured behavior. The trial cookstove was much smaller and more cumbersome than traditional cookstoves, but still, we found that users were willing to prepare fuel and found the cookstove useful for light cooking tasks. Access to USB charging served as a catalyst for adoption of advanced cookstoves as cooking tools and did not increase undesirable â€œcharging onlyâ€� adoption modes. This work suggests that these kinds of USB-enabled cookstoves could be an important tool to improve biomass combustion, increase adoption, and realize meaningful health benefits.",3,,209-217

We use stated preference methods to first characterize household tastes for various features of a more efficient cooking technology. We then relate these typically unobserved preferences to households’ adoption decisions during an experiment that allowed them to choose between two alternatives with different features. Stated preferences help predict actual adoption: households initially classified as uninterested are less likely to purchase and use any new technology, while relative distaste for pollution is linked to selection of a cleaner technology. Because of this influence on adoption behaviors, preference heterogeneity has important implications for how environmental policies can impact various health and development outcomes.",0,,

The availability of wood is decreasing and deforestation is a major ecological problem in Sub-Saharan Africa. The scarcity of wood is demanding for a sustainable solution. The sun seems to provide a good alternative. Solar energy is free, without unhealthy smoke or chances to burns. The idea of using solar energy for cooking is not new: many different techniques have already been tested. Most variants are expensive, and therefore not available for most families in Sub-Saharan Africa. A cheap solar cooking device is the CooKit, a cardboard panel cooker covered with aluminium foil. In the adaptation to the CooKit, as to all innovations, it is important that the users are convinced of the advantages. An important step in the adaptation process is learning how to use the cooking device; the best way to do this is by home practice. Monitoring and evaluating the real use is needed, for it is interesting to know if the CooKit is actually used, and also to find out how women have implemented the new technique in their kitchens. In 2005, the SUPO foundation started a project in Burkina Faso: Programme Energie Solaire Grand-Ouaga (PESGO). The aim of PESGO is to introduce the CooKit in the urban households in Ouagadougou by providing training sessions and home assistance. In this paper, a mid-term review on this small-scale cooking project is presented. The possibilities and challenges of solar cooking are outlined, taking the urban context of Ouagadougou in account. In PESGO, dependence on weather conditions is found to be one of the challenges: if sunrays are blocked by clouds or dust in the air, the cooking will be slowed down. The CooKit cannot replace firewood entirely, and a complementary element has to be found. SUPO is exploring the use of Jatropha oil as a complement to the CooKit. The Jatropha plant is drought tolerant and its fruits contain oil which can be used as fuel substitute.

Newly available liquefied petroleum gas stoves and improved biomass stoves, thought to be substitutes for chulha, lead to different adoption pathways for lower and higher caste households. Lower caste households seem to remove chulha more readily because of sensitivity to chulha's heavy smoke that pollutes their utensils, kitchen, and clothes.

In 2016, 6.7 million Peruvians were living in rural areas. The Fondo de Inclusión Social Energético (FISE) LPG Promotion Program, which began in 2012 and is housed under the Ministry of Energy and Mining, is a government-sponsored initiative aimed at reducing use of solid fuels by increasing access to clean fuel for cooking to poor Peruvian households. Methods- We conducted a mixed methods study incorporating data from publicly available records and reports, a community survey of 375 households in Puno (the province with the largest number of FISE beneficiary households), and in-depth interviews with community members and key stakeholders. We used the Reach, Effectiveness – Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to guide our data collection and analysis efforts. In a sample of 95 households, we also measured 48-hour area concentrations and personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Results - The FISE LPG promotion program has achieved high geographical reach; the program is currently serving households in 100% of districts in Peru. Households with access to electricity may be participating at a higher level than households without electricity because the program is implemented primarily by electricity distributors. In a sample of 95 households, FISE beneficiaries experienced a reduction in kitchen concentrations of PM2.5; however, there were no differences in personal exposures, and both kitchen and personal exposures were above the WHO intermediate target for indoor air quality. Among the 375 households surveyed, stove stacking with biomass fuels was reported in >95% of both beneficiary and non-beneficiary households, with fewer than 5% reporting exclusive use. In-depth interviews suggest that the complexity of the enrollment process and access to LPG distribution points may be key barriers to participating in FISE. Conclusion - The FISE LPG Program has achieved high reach and its targeted subsidy and surcharge-based financing structure represent a potentially feasible and sustainable model for other government programs. However, the prevalence of stove stacking among FISE beneficiaries remains high. There is a need for improved communication channels between program implementers and beneficiaries. FISE should also consider expanding the mobile LPG network and community delivery service to reduce physical barriers and indirect costs of LPG acquisition. Finally, increasing the value of LPG vouchers to completely cover one or two tanks a month, or alternatively, introducing behavior change strategies to reduce monthly LPG usage, may facilitate the transition to exclusive LPG use.",46,,82-93

We examine traditional and improved stove use over a two year follow up period, finding that the more basic rocket stove was used at a higher rate than the higher-tech gasifier stove. While stove use patterns varied by stove group, region, primary cook occupation, and socioeconomic status, use of traditional stoves remained high across most groups. Users perceived that improved stoves were less suitable for cooking a staple dish, Tuo Zaafi (TZ), and technical problems (e.g., battery failures with the gasifier stove) also limited the effectiveness of the intervention.

We aimed to improve the understanding of improved stove use by describing the patterns and predictors of adoption of a semi-gasifier stove and processed biomass fuel intervention in southwestern China. Of 113 intervention homes interviewed, 79% of homes tried the stove, and the majority of these (92%) continued using it 5–10 months later. One to five months after intervention, the average proportion of days that the semi-gasifier stove was in use was modest (40.4% [95% CI 34.3–46.6]), and further declined over 13 months.

Household stove use was positively associated with reported cooking needs and negatively associated with age of the main cook, household socioeconomic status, and the availability of substitute cleaner-burning stoves. Our results show that even a carefully engineered, multi-purpose semi-gasifier stove and fuel intervention contributed modestly to overall household energy use in rural China.",12,7,p. 075004

Since its initial success, the program's adoption rates have stalled despite increasing government support and high rates of user satisfaction. Building on an initial evaluation of the NBP in 2013, this updated assessment identifies multiple changes in its second implementation phase that have undermined the initial momentum of the program. Abrupt interruptions in institutional support, deteriorating supply side services (access to construction agents, masons, repair services) and reduced access to credit for farmers have eroded the service network that the first implementation phase established. Structural changes in the rural economy may also contribute to declining demand. Government support to another biodigester program which offers a lower investment price, but does not provide after-sales services, has also undercut the long-term implementation strategy of the NBP. The paper finds that despite these programmatic changes, the installed biodigesters continue to perform according to expectation and to be maintained and valued by their users, but the future viability of the program remains uncertain.",46,,11-22

Here, we use two modelling frameworks to analyse investments and consequences of achieving total rural electrification and universal access to clean-combusting cooking fuels and stoves by 2030. Our analysis indicates that these targets can be achieved with additional investment of US$200565–86 billion per year until 2030 combined with dedicated policies. Only a combination of policies that lowers costs for modern cooking fuels and stoves, along with more rapid electrification, can enable the realization of these goals. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of accounting for varying demands and affordability across heterogeneous household groups in both analysis and policy setting. While the investments required are significant, improved access to modern cooking fuels alone can avert between 0.6 and 1.8 million premature deaths annually in 2030 and enhance wellbeing substantially",8,0,7 pp

Solar cookers have long been presented as an interesting solution to the world's problem of dwindling fuel wood sources and other environmental problems associated with wood fuel demand for cooking. However, recent GTZ field work in South Africa showed different benefits instead: the use of solar cookers resulted in appreciable fuel and time savings as well as increased energy security for households using commercial fuels. These observations are based on field tests in South Africa that started in 1996 to investigate the social acceptability of solar cookers and to facilitate local production and commercialisation of the technology. Impact studies and use rate studies have been carried out by a number of different organisations since the inception of the project and although commercialisation of the technology has not been achieved to its fullest potential, impact studies indicate that solar cookers have a positive development impact on households through fuel-, energy- and time savings. The article aims to summarise the findings of the various studies and present an overview of use rates and impact data. A variety of factors influence solar cooker use rates, which in turn determine impacts. Some factors are related to the user, some to the environment in which the cooker is used and some to the cooker itself. Ultimately, the data shows that on average, only 17% of solar cooker owners do not use their stoves after purchase and that active solar cooker users utilise their stoves on average for 31% of their cooking incidences. Since the majority of solar stove buyers actually use their stoves and obtain real benefits, this suggests that that solar cookers are indeed not a solution looking for a problem but a solution worth promoting.",35,,1909-1919

In Nicaragua the feasibility of attacking this problem was studied at one of its roots, the demand for and consumption of firewood, through a massive fuel switch towards kerosene. A locally-based foundation distributed 700 high-quality Chinese kerosene stoves, using a credit scheme, both in a village and in a suburb of the capital. Surveys of family fuel consumption for meal preparation were carried out before the intervention and again, one year later, after the intervention. The population's acceptance of the stoves was very high. Proof of this is evident in such factors as (1) the high percentage of delivery of the stoves to 93% and 73%, respectively, of the population that uses firewood or charcoal; (2) the highly enthusiastic reactions elicited from the people during visits by the Foundation's workers; (3) the high usage rate of the stoves (80%); and (4) the overall decrease of 50% in the use of firewood for the involved area. This article is centered around the extent of coverage, social acceptance and community behavior, and the local capacity to perform this fuel switch, while themes related to energy efficiency, energy policy, the greenhouse effect and financial implications are incorporated to indicate the national and international impact of this strategy. Offering an alternative source of fuel to the population is a feasible, cheap and highly appreciated solution to deforestation. Projects using these methods could potentially lower firewood consumption at the national level by 50%. Local organizations are capable of implementing this strategy on a wide scale. The economically less favored classes of the population can be reached without any major constraints, leading at the same time to important positive effects on health. The cost per tonne of carbon emission avoided through this strategy is calculated at US$ 1.7, which is far below standards used in joint implementation programs. A worldwide strategy could lower the present surplus balance of CO2 emission by 13%, maintaining at the same time the natural capacity of CO2 absorption. In this scenario, the world consumption of petroleum products will increase by 0.8%.",3,5,26-39

Through 32 targeted sector expert and household level interviews, we use the “Energy Cultures Framework” to identify normative, material and practice related determinants of the dominant cooking culture(s). We find that cooking behaviour is determined and self-reinforced through everyday social interactions, such as expectations of food taste, the practice of purchasing charcoal, and the ability to undertake daily chores in combination with cooking. The current dominant cooking culture(s) meets little resistance but is reinforced by external factors such as national policy regulation, lack for attractive alternative technologies and accessible charcoal markets. We also explore what might drive change of the dominant cooking culture(s) and find that perceptions vary notably between households and sector experts. While households generally recognise that a change in cooking culture is complex to bring about - as it is determined by a multitude of intertwined “softer” factors - sector experts consistently highlighted “harder” determinants of cooking behaviour such as fuel availability, fuel price and the cost of alternatives as the main triggers of change. This mismatch in understanding of how change is enabled about suggests that top-led interventions to diversify cooking behaviour have much to gain from further considering how norms, practices and material culture determine dominant energy culture(s) in a society.

Ethiopia's dependency on non-sustainable energy, especially for cooking, has been a major concern for the nation for the past 30 years, contributing to deforestation, climate change, and adverse human health impacts. Our objective was to document the work of Gaia Association and the implementation of the ethanol CleanCook stove in the refugee camp and urban settings of Ethiopia. We then assessed the potential for the scale-up of ethanol as a household fuel. We utilized the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of the ethanol cookstove intervention. We obtained secondary data from a variety of sources to evaluate a.) The performance of the CleanCook ethanol stove; b.) Effectiveness of the ethanol cookstove implementation; and, c.) Barriers to scale-up and commercialization of ethanol use as a household fuel. In addition, we conducted primary analysis of qualitative surveys to evaluate the perceptions of the ethanol and adoption of the CleanCook stove. Our case study results provide critical insight into the 13-year implementation of the CleanCook ethanol stove in Ethiopia. Laboratory tests demonstrate that the CleanCook stove reduces harmful emissions compared to biomass stoves, and preliminary field tests show 24-hour average PM2.5 levels of 200 μg/m3. To-date 8731 CleanCook stoves were distributed to refugee households, while an additional 500 were sold at a subsided price to low-income urban households. CleanCook stove users report the continued use of multiple stoves. The CleanCook ethanol stove has been implemented as an energy intervention for the vulnerable refugee population in Ethiopia for over 13 years. There has been limited success of a subsidized CleanCook stove among low-income households in Addis Ababa. This case study demonstrates the complexities of promoting a new fuel for household cooking, and the numerous obstacles and stagnations in implementation. Ethanol demonstrates some potential for scale-up and commercialization as a household fuel in Addis Ababa, but it may require simultaneous stabilization of ethanol supply, growth of a city-wide distribution infrastructure, and an affordably priced stove and fuel.",46,,53-64

Most of the available studies for the South Asia region and particularly for India had mainly focused on the access aspect of clean cooking in terms of fuel or stove. In this study, we particularly focus on the household transition to clean cooking fuel (LPG) in terms of its usage. Using the Tobit regression model for censored data the study highlights the socioeconomic and other factors that may influence LPG transition. The study finds that there could be common as well as location specific factors driving LPG transition. Income linkages with LPG usage may be weak in regions with high prevalence of home produced or collected solid fuel consumption. Duration of LPG acquisition, considered in the study as a factor of behavioural aspect, has emerged as an important variable promoting LPG transition over time. The analysis suggests that LPG capital subsidy scheme, PMUY, has provided a trigger for LPG transition among beneficiary households. Increasing the share of LPG in monthly cooking fuel may require good LPG services such as doorstep delivery.",51,,63-72

Environmental Economics Policy Forum for Ethiopia (EEPFE) & Ethiopian Development Research Institute (EDRI),,https://efdinitiative.org/research/projects/urban-energy-transition-and-technology-adoption-case-tigrai-northern-ethiopia,"Deforestation in Ethiopia has resulted in growing fuel scarcity and higher firewood prices in urban centers. Urban centers have long been dependent on the rural hinterlands for their fuel. The use of biofuels of rural origin covers about 90% of the urban fuel use. The dependence of urban centers on their rural hinterlands has aggravated the deforestation. One response to reducing the pressure of urban centers on their rural hinterlands could be through substitutions between or switching from one fuel to another, i.e., through energy transition. For example, through substituting away or switching from fuelwood to electricity. Electricity as cooking fuel is cleaner and do not cause deforestation. In the literature, the transition from traditional to modern fuels has often been conceptualized as a relatively straightforward three-stage process; with woodfuel the predominant energy source in stage one. Stage two is marked by local deforestation, i.e., decreasing wood availability, and the emergence of markets for such ‘transition’ fuels as charcoal and kerosene. Stage three is characterized by developed markets, rising incomes, and large scale fuel switching to LPG and electricity. However, the argument in here is that it might not be that simple and straightforward and that the extent of the environmental and health effects (positive externalities) generated thereof might be conditioned by technology adoption.",,,

This study applies the concept of socio-technical regime to identify factors which have made this path so erratic. We examine four stages in China's solar PV policy from mid-1990s to 2013 and show that each is characterized by different combinations of policy program. These changes in government policy and in the resultant trajectory of the solar PV sector are attributed to three main sets of variables. The most important of these are events which shape the wider policy priorities of China's government. Secondary factors include the government's poor management of the policy interaction between the domestic solar PV manufacturing industry and the deployment of solar PV across the country, as well as policy learning within government. The general lesson from this study is that the development path of a single element of a national strategy for the low-carbon transition is likely to be erratic, subject as it is to a range of political and economic forces, and to experimentation and learning.",67,,903-912

Transition to cleaner household heating is associated with multiple benefits including improved environmental conditions and health of local residents. This study presents an analysis of data from an indoor survey covering 1030 households in 136 villages of Hebi City in the winter of 2018. The main purpose of this study was to reveal the key factors that affect cleaner heating choices under the national pilot program of the dual substitution policy, which targets the replacement of coal heating with gas and electric heating. The survey showed that electric heating is the most popular heating method, and the adoption of cleaner heating rises with income, and energy and device costs may be the major barriers to adopting cleaner heating. Further, multinomial logit regression was used to investigate the household factors and found that income, heating area, energy cost, and education had significant impacts on heating choices. In addition, the gas substitution policy was more effective in promoting the cleaner heating transition than was the electric substitution policy. Results show that more freedom to choose energies and devices, as well as infrastructure for gas supply and centralized heating, is also vital for the adoption of cleaner heating. Our study provides new insights to improve the details of implementation of the dual substitution policy.",249,,

Recently, there has been more attention to improving energy efficiency in those regions where conventional energy production activities and energy-intensive industries are located, such as the Ruhr area. Although the potential for decentralised combined heat and power (CHP) units is high in this region, local action plans show only modest developments for this technology. In this paper, we address this issue by answering the following research question: Which factors block the uptake and integration of decentralised CHP in the German Ruhr area's energy system? Methods: The multilevel perspective (MLP) was used to analyse the state of system innovation in relation to the uptake and integration of decentralised CHP technology. Prior to the MLP analysis, a stakeholders' analysis was conducted to identify stakeholders' views, positions and experienced barriers regarding the uptake and integration of decentralised CHP technology. Data collection included review of text documents and conducting 11 interviews. Results: Due to many regime barriers blocking niche development, the uptake of decentralised CHP technology is limited. Identified barriers relate to lack of market services and mismatches with user preferences, (sectoral) policies and industrial interests. Conclusions: Observed barriers relate to (i) lack of market services such as financial means for making investments; (ii) user awareness such as unawareness and information deficit regarding the benefits of decentralised CHP to potential users, (iii) the presence of centralised district heating systems, (iv) policy issues such as lack of sufficient policies supporting diffusion of decentralised CHP units, legal stipulations from social housing policies that prevent housing cooperatives from becoming energy producers and district heating systems owned by public and private owners (via concessions contracts); (v) sector issues such as lack of skilled service-providing companies; and (vi) industrial interested such as the vested interests of the coal and gas industry. Moreover, many of the mentioned barriers seem interrelated, especially those concerning policy and finance available for making upfront investments.",5,1,

Access and price have been identified as the main factors that limit substitution of solid fuels by clean fuels. In this paper, we present an exploratory analysis of the effects of subsidy policies for LPG in reducing USF in LAC countries when controlling for indicators of socioeconomic development and urbanization. In LAC, subsidies to LPG have substantially contributed to accelerate the transition from USF to clean fuels for cooking. Targeted subsidies should be considered as a policy option to implement the SDG7 on clean energy. Making clean energy accessible to all has the co-benefits of preventing diseases and premature deaths.

The approach showed that, in the Non-Interconnected Zones of Colombia, substitution of traditional biomass with an electrification scheme using renewable energy sources provides significant environmental benefits, measured as land use and avoided emissions, as well as higher employment generation rates than diesel generation schemes. Nevertheless, fuel substitution is constrained by the elevated cost of electricity compared to traditional biomass, which raises households' energy expenditures between twofold to five times higher values.

A fifth group served as a control (n = 2,377). Interventions were randomized across 32 villages in Wardak province. Outcomes were measured through two household surveys separated by one year and twice-weekly household surveillance conducted over 16 months. The households receiving all three interventions showed reduction in diarrhoea compared with the control group, through both longitudinal surveillance data (IRR [95% CI] = 0.61 [0.47-0.81]) and cross-sectional survey data (AOR [95% CI] = 0.53 [0.30-0.93]). This reduction was significant when all household members were included, but did not reach significance when only children under five were considered. These results suggest multi-barrier methods are necessary where there are many opportunities for water contamination. Surveillance data suggested a greater impact of interventions on reducing diarrhoeal diseases than data from the surveys. Higher economic status as measured through household assets was associated with lower rates of diarrhoea and greater intervention uptake, excepting Clorin. Use of soap was also associated with lower prevalence of diarrhoea. ¬© IWA Publishing 2010.",8,4,687-702

Despite their short and medium-term success, these policies could create a long-term lock-in if they are formulated in a way that leads to a stagnation of systems innovation. The research finds that while the share of wind energy has increased rapidly over time, the feed-in-tariff and other low carbon policies and incentives have not been sufficient to achieve a socio-technical regime transition in Germany yet. We suggest that the German feed-in-tariff has incorporated wind energy (a niche-innovation) and wind energy actors (pathway newcomers) into a slightly modified socio-technical regime that is rather similar to the earlier 'fossil fuel dominant' socio-technical regime.

Behavior change promotion that combined door-to-door personalized demonstrations with information pamphlets was effective. When given a choice amongst products, households strongly preferred an electric stove over improved biomass-burning options. Among different stove attributes, reduced cooking time was considered most valuable by those adopting a new stove. Households clearly identified price as a significant barrier to adoption, while provision of discounts (e.g., rebates given if households used the stove) or payments in installments were related to higher purchase. Place-based factors such as remoteness and nongovernmental organization operations significantly affected the ability to supply and convince households to buy and use improved cookstoves.

By randomly assigning different frames about this energy technology to the villagers, we study how concerns about the cost of sustainable energy, inequality of energy access, and the role of private business and the state shape individuals' acceptance of off-grid solar power. We find that concerns about the role of private business and possible increases in rural-urban inequality are salient among the rural population. The rural population is concerned about (i) exploitative businesses practices and (ii) the inequality that solar power in villages is more expensive than conventional grid power in urban areas.

Traditional bioenergy makes substantial contributions to anthropogenic black carbon (BC) emissions (18?30%) and small contributions to total anthropogenic climate impacts (2?8%). Transitions from traditional fuels and devices have proven difficult. Stacking, i.e., the use of multiple devices and fuels to satisfy household energy needs, is common, showing the need to shift stove interventions from the common approach that promotes one fuel and one device to integrated approaches that incorporate deep understanding of local needs and practices, and multiple fuels and devices, while monitoring residual use of traditional technologies.",40,1,121-150

The absolute quantity of biomass energy used slightly increased when going from rural (5.52 GJ caput?1 y?1) to suburban (6.06 GJ caput?1 y?1) but greatly decreased for urban community (1.98 GJ caput?1 y?1), while the relative share declined with greater urbanization, being 46.2, 37.4 and 10.2% for the rural, suburban and urban communities, respectively. Both firewood and charcoal were used primarily for cooking, with a small amount used for home industry. It was concluded that, although the share of biomass energy in household energy portfolios does decline relative to modern energy sources in the course of urbanization, as predicted by the energy ladder model, there is no sharp discontinuity in utilization of energy sources between communities at different stages of urbanization and biomass continue to be an important component of household energy portfolios in all communities, supporting the fuel stacking model. It appears likely that biomass will remain an important source of household energy in Thailand for an extended period.",10,,"4180-4188

https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X04001858","This paper discusses the factors guiding household choices of cooking fuels. This is crucial for policies to combat indoor air pollution. Household income is an important, but not the only, factor. Opportunity costs of firewood also play an essential role. Empirical results are based on the 2000 Guatemalan LSMS survey, which includes a detailed section on energy use. Patterns of fuel use, energy spending, Engel curves, multiple fuels, the extent of fuel switching, and the determinants of fuel choice are analyzed. It is common in Guatemala to use multiple fuels for cooking – 48 and 27 per cent of urban and rural households do so. Modern fuels are often used alongside traditional solid fuels; modern fuels thus fail to displace solid fuels in many cases, particular in rural areas and the urban bottom half. This is paradoxical since a significant share of firewood users buy wood from the market, incurring costs that are substantial, also in comparison with the costs of modern fuels.",10,3,337–361

Although traditional biofuels already enjoy widespread popularity, their use has often been actively discouraged due to the lingering influence of “fuelwood crisis” era narratives. In particular, urban fuelwood consumption is frequently portrayed as a cause of environmental degradation leading to energy insecurity among low-income households, especially where the resource is commercialized. Such views have had significant influence among policy makers, often resulting in repressive forestry legislation. In contrast, however, a number of researchers have demonstrated that wood energy dependence is often not a significant cause of deforestation and can provide important livelihood opportunities. This article reassesses urban fuelwood sourcing and its impacts using a recent case study conducted by the authors in Maun, Botswana and results previously reported in the literature. Findings indicate that although harvesting is unregulated, its impacts are significantly mitigated by collectors' strong preferences for source sites with abundant dead wood, low competition and recognized access rights. As well, fuelwood vending is found to provide critical support to rural incomes and a key source of low-cost urban energy. As such, the benefits of fuelwood use and avoidance of negative effects will most effectively be achieved by decentralised management approaches that build on local institutions and understandings of the resource.",11,,"1605-1616

Exposure to household air pollution from burning these fuels is estimated to account for approximately 3 million premature deaths a year. Cleaner fuels – such as liquefied petroleum gas, biogas, electricity, and certain compressed biomass fuels – have the potential to alleviate much of this significant health burden. A wide variety of clean cooking intervention pro- grams are being implemented around the world, but very few of these efforts have been analyzed to enable global learning. The Clean Cooking Implementation Science Network (ISN), supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and partners, identified the need to augment the publicly available literature concerning what has worked well and in what context. The ISN has supported the development of a systematic set of case studies, contained in this Special Issue, examining clean cooking program rollouts in a variety of low- and middle-income settings around the world.

The initiative has set itself the lofty aim of providing energy service comparable to clean sources such as LPG but using the same solid biomass fuels commonly used today. Such a clean energy option for the estimated 160 million Indian households now cooking with inefficient and polluting biomass and coal cookstoves could yield enormous gains in health and welfare for the weakest and most vulnerable sections of society. At the same time, cleaner household cooking energy through substitution by advanced-combustion biomass stoves (or other options such as clean fuels) can nearly eliminate the several important products of incomplete combustion that come from today's practices and are important outdoor and greenhouse pollutants. Using national surveys, published literature and assessments, and measurements of cookstove performance solely from India, we find that about 570,000 premature deaths in poor women and children and over 4% of India's estimated greenhouse emissions could be avoided if such an initiative were in place today. These avoided emissions currently would be worth more than US$1 billion on the international carbon market. In addition, about one-third of India's black carbon emissions can be reduced along with a range of other health- and climate-active pollutants that affect regional air quality and climate. Although current advanced biomass stoves show substantial emissions reductions over traditional stoves, there is still additional improvement needed to reach LPG-like emission levels. We recognize that the technology development and deployment challenges to meet NCI goals of this scale are formidable and a forthcoming companion paper focuses on what program design elements might best be able to overcome these challenges.",14,2,63-72

The purpose of this case study was to describe how culture and social perceptions affect the adoption and use of ICSs. Results showed that stoves in this rural Guatemalan community had several layers of practical importance beyond cooking food. Most prominently, household members valued stoves as heat and light sources, and as a social gathering point for families. Most ICS models have been purposely designed in controlled conditions to deliver maximum heating efficiency at the lowest production cost. However, this case study revealed that the fuel-efficient designs sacrificed important functional, social, and cultural needs. Efforts to increase adoption rates of ICSs will be more successful if the macro-level â€œtriple benefitsâ€� paradigm is adapted to include functional consumer-centric benefits beyond heating food, such as providing heat and ambient light.

The results show that the price elasticity of demand for all fossil fuels is low, but the respective income elasticity is higher. Therefore, an increase in the general price level caused by the subsidy reform will lead to the erosion of real income and will have related welfare implications in India. The results also reveal that energy expenditure will obviously increase and hence energy consumption will decline depending upon the extent of the withdrawal of subsidy. Therefore, policy makers in India, while undertaking further reforms, must ensure that the subsidy reaches to those who truly deserve, so that the socioeconomic casualty of reforms can be minimized along with achieving fiscal goals",102,,453-462

However, the change in mortality risk associated with such a transition remains unclear. Methods- The China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) Study enrolled participants (aged 30–79 years) from ten areas across China; we chose to study participants from five urban areas where transition from use of solid fuels to clean fuels for cooking was prevalent. Participants who reported regular cooking (weekly or more frequently) at baseline were categorised as persistent clean fuel users, previous solid fuel users, or persistent solid fuel users, according to selfreported fuel use histories. All-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality were identified through linkage to China’s Disease Surveillance Point system and local mortality records. Findings-  Between June 24, 2004, and July 15, 2008, 226186 participants living in five urban areas of China were enrolled in the CKB Study. Among 171677 participants who reported cooking regularly (weekly or more frequently), 75785 (44%) were persistent clean fuel users, 80511 (47%) were previous solid fuel users, and 15381 (9%) were persistent solid fuel users. During a mean of 9·8 (SD 1·7) years of follow-up, 10831 deaths were documented, including 3819 cardiovascular deaths and 761 respiratory deaths. Compared with persistent clean fuel users, persistent solid fuel users had significantly higher risks of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1·19, 95% CI 1·10–1·28), cardiovascular mortality (1·24, 1·10–1·39), and respiratory mortality (1·43, 1·10–1·85). The excess risk of all-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality fell by more than 60% in 5 years after cessation of solid fuel use and continued to decrease afterwards. Use of ventilation was associated with lower all-cause mortality risk, even among persistent clean fuel users (HR 0·78, 0·69–0·89). Interpretation-  Solid fuel use for cooking is associated with a higher risk of mortality, and cessation of solid fuel use cuts excess mortality risks swiftly and substantially within 5 years. Ventilation use also lowers the risk of mortality, even among people who persistently use clean fuels. It is of prime importance for both policy makers and the public to accelerate the transition from solid fuels to clean fuels and promote efficient ventilation to minimise further adverse health effects.",,Jan19th,10 pp

The objectives were to delineate and evaluate the methods used to promote improved stoves, to assess the development of commercial stove production and marketing organizations, and to measure the household impacts of the programs through surveys of health, stoves, and indoor air quality. The team found that China implemented broadly successful programs that delivered better stoves to a majority of households in targeted counties. That success was based on strong administrative, technical, and outreach competence and resources situated at the local level, motivated by sustained national-level attention. Despite overstated claims for penetration of improved stoves, mostbiomass stoves now in use have flues and other ‚Äúimproved‚Äù aspects, although field efficiencies are less than design efficiencies. However, most coal stoves, even those using improved fuel (briquettes), lack flues and cannot be considered improved. While in most areas ‚Äúimproved‚Äù stove technology became ‚Äúconventional‚Äù, some areas remain significant exceptions and require intervention. Large roles for government oversight of quality control and support of R&D remain inadequately fulfilled. Most results of indoor air quality monitoring and health surveys were not clear-cut, in part because of the wide variety of fuel and stove combinations used by households. For nearly all household stove/fuel groupings, however, PM4 levels were higher than ‚Äì and sometimes more than twice as high as ‚Äì the national standard for indoor air (150 Œºg PM10/m3). If these results are typical, then a large fraction of China's rural population is now chronically exposed to levels of pollution far higher than those determined by the Chinese government to harm human health. Improved stoves in the surveyed households did result in reduced PM4 concentrations indoors for biomass fuel combinations. Coal use was associated with elevated levels of CO in exhaled breath, and improved biomass stoves with lower levels. Childhood asthma and adult respiratory disease were positively associated with coal use and negatively associated with improved stoves and good stove maintenance. The benefits of using improved biomass stoves can be outweighed by the use of portable coal stoves without flues.

During the 1980s and 1990s several programs aiming at testing and disseminating energy saving technologies were implemented in Sudan. One of these technologies was improved cookstoves, which was intended to increase the efficiency of using energy from biomass sources. This study is carried out to examine the adoption rate and the factors affecting adoption of improved cookstoves in Khartoum State. The study is based on primary data collected through personal interviews with husbands and wives in 300 randomly selected households. Regression analysis was used to analyze the data.

Improved cookstoves are one of few available interventions, but achieving equity in cookstove access has been challenging. Therefore, innovative approaches are needed. To evaluate a project designed to motivate adoption of locally-produced, ceramic cookstoves (upesi jiko) in an impoverished, rural African population, we assessed the perceived benefits of the cookstoves (in monetary and time-savings terms), the rate of cookstove adoption, and the equity of adoption. Methods: The project was conducted in 60 rural Kenyan villages in 2008 and 2009. Baseline (n = 1250) and follow-up (n = 293) surveys and a stove-tracking database were analyzed. Results: At baseline, nearly all respondents used wood (95%) and firepits (99%) for cooking; 98% desired smoke reductions. Households with upesi jiko subsequently spent <100 Kenyan Shillings/week on firewood more often (40%) than households without upesi jiko (20%) (p = 0.0002). There were no significant differences in the presence of children <2 years of age in households using upesi jiko (48%) or three-stone stoves (49%) (p = 0.88); children 2–5 years of age were less common in households using upesi jiko versus three-stone stoves (46% and 69%, respectively) (p = 0.0001). Vendors installed 1,124 upesi jiko in 757 multi-family households in 18 months; 68% of these transactions involved incentives for vendors and purchasers. Relatively few (<10%) upesi jiko were installed in households of women in the youngest age quartile (<22 years) or among households in the poorest quintile. Conclusions: Our strategy of training of local vendors, appropriate incentives, and product integration effectively accelerated cookstove adoption into a large number of households. The strategy also created opportunities to reinforce health messages and promote cookstoves sales and installation. However, the project’s overall success was diminished by inequitable and incomplete adoption by households with the lowest socioeconomic status and young children present. Additional evaluations of similar strategies will be needed to determine whether our strategy can be applied equitably elsewhere, and whether reductions in fuel use, household air pollution, and the incidence of respiratory diseases will follow adoption of improved cookstoves.",12,1,359
