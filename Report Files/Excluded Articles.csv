J.; Simbeck, D.",Assessing Innovative National Policy Options and Roles for CCS in a Post-Kyoto,10th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies,1876-6102,,,"The highly contentious, complex negotiations over the past several years to establish a globally more-inclusive, post-Kyoto Framework illustrate the daunting complexity and diversity of interests, which had to be accommodated. Notwithstanding the many challenges, a ""Copenhagen Accord"" was reached at the December 2009 15th Conference of Parties (COP 15) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Copenhagen, Denmark. That Accord provided the basis for subsequent delineation of the post-Kyoto Framework in 2010 at the meetings in Mexico City, Mexico. Adoption of more flexibility in the approaches nations can employ to achieve significant, verifiable emissions reductions is among the many critical and necessary accommodations made to achieve more inclusive participation from developing economies and other large economies that did not adhere to the Kyoto Protocol. Negotiations also had to address trade and national sovereignty issues as well. This flexibility is an essential recognition of national and cultural differences including differences in levels of national and sub-national economic wealth and growth, status of energy infrastructure development, and national energy resource endowments. This paper presents research findings from a project using a step-by-step methodology. The first step was defining a set of generic, guiding principles for economically efficient and effective national emissions reduction programs. These were employed to design a comprehensive portfolio of innovative national policy and technology strategies that could be adopted by large, developed economies as well as some large developing economies. A specific example is presented using the United States as the test case. The cost-effectiveness of the innovative policy and technology portfolio is assessed for the test case based on a number of effectiveness measures, including: projected economic impacts and emissions reductions, national security impacts, energy-related impacts on water use and other environmental aspects, and regional economic equity. The assessment methodology employs a Reference Case Scenario (RCS), based on the Annual Energy Outlook 2010 energy projections (AEO 2010) of the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), extended through 2050. The EIA energy projections are a widely used basis for projecting future energy demand, supply, and prices in the United States. They provide a comprehensive economy-wide reference data set. Particular attention is given to the electric generation, transportation, and industrial sectors, which account for the majority of energy production, demand, and emissions. A Policy and Technology Innovations Scenario (PTIS) is constructed covering all sectors of the energy economy with special attention as described above. The case specifications include new Federal and State legislative innovations and modifications to existing laws, regulatory reforms and innovations, and enhanced low-carbon technology innovation programs. Based on the PTIS case specifications, the incremental energy, economic, emissions, and other impacts from successful adoption and implementation of the PTIS case are projected as changes to the Reference Case Scenario using transparent techno-economic modeling approaches. The enhanced, low-carbon energy technology innovations programs included in the PTIS case cover a broad spectrum of energy supply and demand innovations. Particular attention is given to innovations that increase energy efficiency in both production and uses of energy in all economic sectors. Recognizing the extremely large energy infrastructure and imbedded capital investments already existing in the United States, special attention is given to innovations to transform and expand that infrastructure to meet future clean energy needs. The latter is a key strategy for making the transition affordable. One focus of attention is innovative opportunities for Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS). These are described along with the policy, regulatory, and technology improvements necessary to enable those contributions. The quantitative and qualitative differences between the two Scenarios are compared using the effectiveness measures adopted. These comparisons confirm that a portfolio such as that modeled in this project can lead to significant, affordable emissions reductions in the near term, and establish a pathway to a future energy economy with much larger reductions in energy use and emissions than the Reference Case in the longer term. Other key insights and conclusions from the assessment are described. The national and sub-national political, economic, and regulatory barrier and constraint challenges to successful implementation of a PTIS case are presented along with options for overcoming those challenges.

Statistics highlights that now the urban population in India is 31%. As a result, pace of urbanization would speed-up to combat the need of inhabitants of those cities. In this context the Government of India has decided to set up 100 ""Smart Cities"" in India (as observed from the budget speech of Finance Minister of India in 2014) to face the situation since if this is right now not achieved, the existing cities would very soon become unlivable. However to achieve this, ""Smart Technology"" is essential which in particular, means improvement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) along with other essential services.

The present study aimed at estimating the factors that affect adoption of biogas plant and analysing the factors responsible for the improvement of livelihoods of the biogas users. The study was based on primary data collected from randomly chosen 50 biogas user households and 30 non users in Ghatail and Fulbaria upazilas (sub district) of Tangail and Mymensingh district respectively. Required data were collected adopting direct farm survey method during January to February, 2015. Binary logistic regression model was used to analyse the data. The findings of the study reveal that education, income, farm size, number of cattle and cost of fuel were positively associated with the adoption of biogas technology. The major findings of the logistic regression showed that respondents having education over 8 years had 20.78 times more possibility of adopting biogas technology than tthose who had education less than 8 years of schooling. The probability of adopting biogas plant by a household owning land above 0.60 hactare was 7.31 times higher than those households owning land less than 0.60 hactare. The results of the logistic regression model fitted for livelihood improvement revealed that a biogas user who supplied gas to other consumer is 11.66 times more likely to achieve moderate improvement in livelihood than the user who could not supply gas to other consumer. The findings also showed that environmental and econmic factors were the two vital factors influencing the adoption of biogas. This study highlighted on the strategies such as organizing training, publicity program, motivational activities on biogas technology; encourage more educated people to adopt biogas technology and expanding subsidy and loan provision, extending period of loan repayment to increase the likelihood of adopting biogas plants.",,,1642-1661,agricultural households; biogas; energy; environmental factors; livelihoods; rural areas; socioeconomics; technology transfer,

As wastewater regulations become more stringent, wastewater treatment plants reach capacity, and water resources become more strained, the benefits of urine diversion become more appealing. By using nonwater urinals and urine-diverting toilets, urine diversion systems seek to collect undiluted human urine for nutrient recovery and pharmaceutical sequestration. Urine is a unique, nutrient-rich waste stream that constitutes an overall low volume of waste entering a wastewater treatment plant. If urine is separated at the building-scale, various technologies can be used to recover nutrients and sequester pharmaceuticals at their most concentrated location. However, the implementation of urine diversion requires a paradigm shift from conventional comingling of wastewater and centralized treatment to source separation and decentralized treatment.This Account proposes a vision for building-scale implementation of urine diversion with the goal of clarifying the opportunities and challenges in this context. The main components of urine, i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and pharmaceuticals, are major drivers for technology development and system implementation. Stepping back, the benefits from water conservation and effects on wastewater treatment are an extension of the system boundary that can impact the sustainability of adjacent systems. However, major challenges have been identified in the literature as hurdles for widespread implementation of urine diversion. Challenges include the comparison of recovering nutrients at the wastewater plant versus at the source, the collection and storage of urine, the ability to recover nutrients and sequester pharmaceuticals, and the overall environmental and economic impacts of urine diversion systems. While these challenges exist, studies have been conducted to address some of the underlying research questions. As more research is conducted, the vision of a seamless urine diversion system with building-wide plumbing and storage comes closer to reality. As such, the application of urine diversion systems will benefit from technology development and research to fill gaps that have been identified.It is important to classify urine diversion systems as a process and not a product. This has implications for the way these systems are evaluated, as their impact on peripheral systems can be of benefit to different stakeholders. In the same light, new research areas, such as cyber-physical systems, reverse logistics, and sustainability transitions, can be applied to urine diversion as approaches for ensuring a robust process for widespread implementation. However, established technologies should be constantly reassessed and enhanced by newer techniques. For example, membrane distillation, eutectic freeze concentration, and solar evaporation should be considered for nutrient recovery and volume reduction because they offer benefits over conventional technologies. Finally, the human behavior component of urine diversion cannot be ignored, as negative user acceptance and improper maintenance of these systems can have a detrimental impact on their future implementation.

The project provided irrigation management training and infrastructure upgrade grants for licensed river, and potable water irrigators in peri-urban areas of the Sydney Basin, securing 5,900 megalitres of water savings and preventing export of 19 t of nitrogen and 7 t of phosphorus annually. Greenhouse vegetable producers in the region are mostly from culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Enterprises are small with tight cash flows with uncertain land tenure due to potential rezoning. Investing in expensive water efficient infrastructure (e.g., disinfection and filtration systems) presented a major barrier to technology uptake. To address these barriers the extension team decided on a 'two-pronged' approach which utilised demonstration farms showcasing basic low-cost technology (rainwater harvesting tanks) and high-tech, high-cost recycling systems (UV, ozone, copper ionisation and ultra-filtration systems). Concurrently, the services of independent auditors were engaged to assess the water savings potential options for growers. The demonstration sites have assisted in increasing uptake of recycling projects with potable water savings of up to 23 ML per annum per site being realised along with significant reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus export into the catchment area. Financial analysis of hydroponic greenhouse vegetable recycling project sites has shown a payback period of two years. Overall, the project has provided some valuable data and lessons that will help in developing water management strategies or long-term water security and river health in peri-urban landscapes.",1112,,31-37,International Society for Horticultural Science,

In particular, we examine whether a process of technology substitution exists that influences the diffusion process of the surgical technology. Given their different cost implications, the interaction of these two different technologies, surgery and drug intervention, is relevant from the perspective of health expenditure. This is of particular interest in health care as technology adoption and diffusion has been cited as a major driver of expenditure growth. Such expenditure growth has been increasingly targeted through the use of market-orientated policy tools aimed at increasing efficiency. Our research is thus addressing the question of how economic incentives influence the diffusion process and we discuss the impact of a set of incentives on hospital behavior. Design/methodology - Hospital admission data for the financial years 1998/1999 to 2007/2008 in England are used to empirically test the contribution of prescription uptake and market-oriented reforms. Dynamic panel data models are used to capture any changes in technology preference during the period of study. Findings - Our results suggest that the hospital sector exhibits a strong new technology preference, tempered by the interaction of competition for patients and the ability of the primary care sector to substitute treatments. Value/originality - Given the current fast technological change, we examine the technological race occurring in the health care sector. We account simultaneously for the diffusion of different technologies not only within the same typology but also with technologies of a different class.

P.",Risk Clustering as a finance concept for rural electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa to attract international private investors,Africa-Eu Symposium on Renewable Energy Research and Innovation,1876-6102,,,"Projects in the energy sector in Africa suffer from a number of barriers. Especially the combination of political instability and an unclear regulatory framework hampers the private sector to realize the investment possibilities in the field of decentralized rural electrification. For debt based projects these barriers result in prohibitively high interest rates - roughly 15 % while the return on investment does not exceed the low 10% area. This situation leads to strong reluctance from private investors to provide equity. A possibility to encourage private investors to step in could be a separation of the different risks, especially separating the typical high sovereign risk of a country from the commercial risk of the energy project. As a result, the separated risks can be clearly allocated to different investor groups looking for investment opportunities going along with distinct risks. A structured approach is proposed through which private international investors are exposed only to the general political risk while international development banks cover mainly the regulatory risk. Finally, the newly invented financial instrument convertible grant by the electriFI initiative of the EU provides an equity substitute to take over the commercial risk. With this additional financial support, decentralized electrification projects in Africa have the possibility to be implemented and the potential to be scaled up. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Most of the cross price effects are negative values indicating complementarity between energy goods. This suggests that substitution possibilities between energy goods are quite limited. However, kerosene is shown to be the main fuel used for cooking by about 90 per cent of households; the use of LPG and electricity is minimal. The income group analysis further shows that kerosene is preferred across all income groups.

Therefore, this work has examined the problem. Small-scale fisheries (SSF) are the dominant source of local fish production in Nigeria and, like many fisheries worldwide, receive inadequate attention for their significance within the context of food and nutritional security. A central theme to guaranteeing small-scale fisheries' contribution to sustainable food and nutritional security in Nigeria is addressing post-harvest losses (PHL). Considerable fish loss occurs between production and consumption. A narrative review was conducted to expose PHL practiced by SSF and discuss factors that prevent the adoption of locally available interventions. Finding: Our study revealed that sun-drying and smoking are the major interventions practiced to mitigate PHL. Unfortunately, these methods of reducing PHL are constrained by gross under-capacity and improper handling during peak fishing periods and issues related to product safety. There are a handful of potential intervention mechanisms to address issues of PHL. Many of these PHL-reducing interventions have been designed bearing in mind local contexts and situations. However, general inertia and poor policy implementation currently hamper progress for reducing PHL. Conclusion: A plethora of strategies are proposed to reduce PHL from SSF as contained in national and regional documents such as the National Policy on Food and Nutrition (NPFN), National Policy on Food and Nutrition in Nigeria (NPFNN), National Energy Policy (NEP), and Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). Recommendations are offered on identified gaps in areas of technological adoption, safety, and product quality issues, which are detrimental to traditional fish processing systems.",6,34,,constraints; drying; fish; fish processing; fisheries; food policy; food preservation; food security; innovation adoption; nutrition security; postharvest losses; smoking,

Participants: In the Département du Centre of rural Haiti comprehensive HIV and tuberculosis treatment is provided free of charge to anyone who presents for care. All those who meet clinical enrolment criteria are treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Intervention: HAART was provided in the context of a comprehensive programme of HIV, tuberculosis (TB), sexually transmitted disease (STD) of the project, treatment and prevention, and women's health services at four sites in the first year. At each site, the medical facility was renovated, additional staff were hired as needed, and a network of accompagnateurs (community health workers) was established throughout the surrounding villages to serve as a link with the community, and to provide directly observed treatment (DOT). Results: In the first year of programme scale-up, over 8000 patients were followed for HIV, and over 1050 were treated with DOT HAART. Adherence to HAART was very high, and clinical outcomes were excellent: all patients responded with weight gain and improved functional capacity, and fewer than 5% required medication changes due to side effects. Viral load was tested among a subset of patients showing that 86% had undetectable viral loads. Conclusion: Community-based care of AIDS has been highly effective in rural Haiti.

Our econometric results show that income growth can induce less use of biomass and more use of coal and modern fuels. However, no evidence shows that even wealthy households has abandoned biomass use in Shanxi, mainly due to the ""free"" access to land and agricultural resources in these villages. Previous wealth of a household represented by house value can lead to more time spent on biomass collection. Access to land resources has positive effects on biomass use and collection.

To be sustainable and acceptable by all social groups, such process should be based on understanding of positions of different stakeholders and development of compromise solutions. It is crucial to understand the views of young people on deployment of RES as young people represent a significant share of population and are future decision makers. Their support and willingness to use RES will be a significant driver for RES deployment in short and medium term. Based on socio cognitive theory this paper examines the patters of behavior of young adults in relation to energy use. The results show positive influence of self-rewarding to encourage young adults to participate in energy transition. Another important driver is expectation of social outcome, which involves existing social norms in the community. Trust to the source of information is another important driver and the level of information about RES has an important influence on the willingness to use them. ¬© 2018 the Author(s).",6,2,216-228,Energy policy in iran; Human factors of energy transition; Renewable energy sources; Young people,

The major challenge for harvesting is the handling of large volumes of cultivation water to concentrate low amounts of biomass. For lipid extraction, the major energy and cost drivers are associated with disrupting the algae cell wall and drying the biomass before solvent extraction of the lipids. Here we review the research and development conducted by the Harvesting and Extraction Team during the 3-year National Alliance for Advanced Biofuels and Bioproducts (NAABB) algal consortium project. The harvesting and extraction team investigated five harvesting and three wet extraction technologies at lab bench scale for effectiveness, and conducted a techoeconomic study to evaluate their costs and energy efficiency compared to available baseline technologies. Based on this study, three harvesting technologies were selected for further study at larger scale. The selected harvesting technologies: electrocoagulation, membrane filtration, and ultrasonic harvesting, were evaluated in a field study at minimum scale of 100 L/h. None of the extraction technologies were determined to be ready for scale-up; therefore, an emerging extraction technology (wet solvent extraction) was selected from industry to provide scale-up data and capabilities to produce lipid and lipid-extracted materials for the NAABB program. One specialized extraction/adsorption technology was developed that showed promise for recovering high value co-products from lipid extracts. Overall, the NAABB Harvesting and Extraction Team improved the readiness level of several innovative, energy efficient technologies to integrate with algae production processes and captured valuable lessons learned about scale-up challenges. ¬© 2017 The Authors",33,,470-485,Electrolytic; Extraction; Harvesting; Membranes; NAABB; Ultrasound,

Lack of access to sufficient and sustainable supplies of energy affects as much as 90% of the population of many developing countries. Some 2 billion people are without electricity; a similar number remain dependent on fuels such as animal dung, crop residues, wood, and charcoal to cook their daily meals. Without efficient, clean energy, people are undermined in their efforts to engage effectively in productive activities or to improve their quality of life. Developing countries are facing two crucial-and related-problems in the energy sector. The first is the widespread inefficient production and use of traditional energy sources, such as fuelwood and agricultural residues, which pose economic, environmental, and health threats. The second is the highly uneven distribution and use of modern energy sources, such as electricity, petroleum products, and liquefied or compressed natural gas, which pose important issues of economics, equity, and quality of life. To address these problems, this paper evaluates some successful programs and recommends that governments support market-oriented approaches that make the energy market equally accessible and attractive to local investors, communities, and consumers. Such approaches ideally improve access to energy for rural and poor people by revising energy pricing and by making the first costs of the transition to modern and more sustainable uses of energy more affordable.",21,,497-530,,

However, knowledge about the environmental impacts of traditional bioenergy is fragmented. This review addresses several persistent questions and summarizes recent research on land cover change (LCC) and pollution emissions resulting from traditional bioenergy use. We also review recent studies analyzing transitions from traditional bioenergy to cleaner stoves and fuels. Between 27 and 34% of the wood fuel harvest in 2009 was unsustainable, with large geographical variations. Almost 300 million rural people live in wood fuel ?hotspots,? concentrated in South Asia and East Africa, creating risks of wood-fuel-driven degradation. Different fuels and stoves show variation in climate-forcing emissions. Many, but not all, nontraditional stoves result in lower emissions than traditional models. Traditional bioenergy makes substantial contributions to anthropogenic black carbon (BC) emissions (18?30%) and small contributions to total anthropogenic climate impacts (2?8%). Transitions from traditional fuels and devices have proven difficult. Stacking, i.e., the use of multiple devices and fuels to satisfy household energy needs, is common, showing the need to shift stove interventions from the common approach that promotes one fuel and one device to integrated approaches that incorporate deep understanding of local needs and practices, and multiple fuels and devices, while monitoring residual use of traditional technologies.",40,1,121-150,,

By careful selection of components into a product package with micro-finance used for the capital payment, barriers to large-scale uptake of products that remove HAP are reduced. Such products reduce smoke from cooking and the lighting from electricity produced, eliminates smoke from kerosene lamps. A bottom-up financial model, that is cognisant of end user social needs, has been developed to compare different products for use in rural areas of developing countries. The model is freely available for use by researchers and has the ability to assist in the analysis of changing assumptions. Business views of an individual villager, the village itself and a country view are presented. The model shows that affordability (defined as the effect on household expenses as a result of a product purchase) and recognition of end-user social needs are as important as product cost. The effects of large-scale deployment (greater that 10 million per year) are described together with level of subsidy required by the poorest people. With the assumptions given, the model shows that pico-hydro is the most cost effective, but not generally available, one thermo-acoustic technology option does not require subsidy, but it is only at technology readiness level 2 (NASA definition) therefore costs are predicted and very large investment in manufacturing capability is needed to meet the cost target. Thermo-electric is currently the only technology that can be used worldwide every day of the year and is available without research. However, it is not yet self-financing and therefore requires subsidy or diversion of more household income to be affordable. A combination of photovoltaic and clean cookstove may be suitable in areas where sufficient solar radiation is available on most days. Affordability is shown to be highly dependent on the income that can be derived from carbon credits. ¬© 2014 The Authors.",132,,308-316,Affordability; Cookstove; Score-Stove; Thermo-acoustic; Thermo-electric; Developing countries; Finance; Lighting; NASA; Stoves; Sun; Rural areas; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; electricity generation; energy efficiency; household energy; lightning; numerical model; pollution control; rural area; solar radiation; sustainable development,

A multi-stage stratified random sampling technique was applied in selecting 240 households from four upazilas of Bangladesh. Door to door questionnaire survey was carried out for this study. The results revealed that the majority of rural households had a high level of knowledge on traditional biomass fuels such as wood fuel, crop residues and cow dung. However, they possessed a relatively low level of knowledge regarding improved biomass fuels such as briquette, biogas and biodiesel. The analysis showed that the household's socio-economic status and their level of education plays a significant role in the promotion of knowledge on various renewable and adoption on renewable energy technologies. The rural households expressed negative perceptions towards sustainability aspects of current biomass fuel consumption. Perceptions of various interventions which may have influence on promotion of knowledge on renewables and promotion of sustainable use of bioenergy resource were discussed.

Transition management has emerged as a promising approach to proactively manage and accelerate transitions in sectors like energy and water and has the potential to do so in manner that would help secure energy justice. However, the approach has been criticised for ignoring the political dynamics of transitions, risking procedural and recognition injustice for traditional energy production regions while increasing opposition to a transition. This paper uses a qualitative case study approach to understand how a transition to renewable energy generation could be achieved in a way that secures energy justice for traditional energy production regions like those of Gladstone in the Australian state of Queensland. The paper augments the transition management approach with the & #x0201C;just transitions‚Äù concept, which has emerged from labour movements as a means to mitigate negative impacts on workers and communities in traditional energy production regions, to create a & #x0201C;Just Transition Management‚Äù framework that is applied as a diagnostic tool to the case study. While results suggest a transition is imminent within Queensland, a lack of: consistent, supportive federal policy; long-term visions, and a clear process leaves it at risk of being captured by the powerful incumbent resources sector utilising an & #x0201C;environment vs. jobs‚Äù narrative. Yet, the results also suggest that adopting a just transition management approach has the potential to successfully resist the influence of the resources sector, by providing cheap, secure renewable energy and supporting affected workers into roles in the renewable energy sector using a reflexive, representative network governance approach. Data analysis reveals how the application of just transition principles has already engaged communities and unions that were previously sceptical of renewable energy. Overall, this study suggests that the just transition management framework assists in identifying the political barriers to transitions and energy justice more broadly, while also providing a management approach which creates powerful niche actor-networks to counter the narratives and influence of the incumbent resource sector. Thus it could support successful transitions that achieve the distributional, recognition and procedural justice needed for energy justice globally. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",225,,110-123,Australia; Energy transformation; Just transitions; Renewable energy; Sustainability transitions; Transitions management; Climate change; Energy policy; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Electricity generation sectors; Qualitative case studies; Renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Sustainability transition; Human resource management; acceleration; electricity generation; governance approach; mitigation; renewable resource; risk assessment; sustainability; Gladstone; Queensland,

These resources may support a pathway to both economic growth and a low-carbon future. This natural gas could be used locally for a host of different applications such as cooking, power generation, transportation and fertilizer production. The aim of this paper is to investigate how the potential future demand for natural gas across sectors and countries might impact the economic viability of an investment in a new regional transmission and distribution gas network in Eastern and Southern Africa. We analyze the economic viability by using future demand and pricing data inferred for biomass, charcoal, LPG and liquid fuels currently being used in the continent. The investment and transmission costs are assessed for various scenarios of transmission pipeline networks. Then, a detailed analysis for a gas transmission network across eight Eastern African countries is presented. Results suggest that the development of a regional gas pipeline network within the continent is an attractive investment (based on internal regional demand as well as co-benefits to economy, environment and health) that can complement LNG export, which is the dominant market option being considered to enable the large upstream investments.",143,,414-436,Natural gas; East Africa; Pipeline; Regional development,

However, individual firms still encounter technical and financial barriers that hinder the installation of renewables. The eco-industrial park approach aims to create synergies among firms thereby enabling them to share and efficiently use natural and economic resources. It also provides a suitable model to encourage the use of renewable energy sources in the industry sector. Synergies among eco-industrial parks and the adjacent urban areas can lead to the development of optimized energy production plants, so that the excess energy is available to cover some of the energy demands of nearby towns. This study thus provides an overview of the scientific literature on energy synergies within eco-industrial parks, which facilitate the uptake of renewable energy sources at the industrial level, potentially creating urban-industrial energy symbiosis. The literature analysis was conducted by arranging the energy-related content into thematic categories, aimed at exploring energy symbiosis options within eco-industrial parks. It focuses on the urban-industrial energy symbiosis solutions, in terms of design and optimization models, technologies used and organizational strategies.

These resources may support a pathway to both economic growth and a low-carbon future. This natural gas could be used locally for a host of different applications such as cooking, power generation, transportation and fertilizer production. The aim of this paper is to investigate how the potential future demand for natural gas across sectors and countries might impact the economic viability of an investment in a new regional transmission and distribution gas network in Eastern and Southern Africa. We analyze the economic viability by using future demand and pricing data inferred for biomass, charcoal, LPG and liquid fuels currently being used in the continent. The investment and transmission costs are assessed for various scenarios of transmission pipeline networks. Then, a detailed analysis for a gas transmission network across eight Eastern African countries is presented. Results suggest that the development of a regional gas pipeline network within the continent is an attractive investment (based on internal regional demand as well as co-benefits to economy, environment and health) that can complement LNG export, which is the dominant market option being considered to enable the large upstream investments.",143,,414-436,Natural gas; East Africa; Pipeline; Regional development,

Efficient policy frameworks and effective electrification programs are required in order to ensure that people are electrified in a sustainable manner. These programs differ from country to country depending on geographic and socioeconomic conditions. Electrification planning process must consider the geographical characteristics of the resources as well as the spatial dimension of social and economic drivers of energy demand in order to find the most optimal energy access solution. Geographical theory and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in particular can play a significant role in electrification planning, since they are capable of managing the data needed in the decision making process and may integrate and assess all possible options. This paper focuses on considering these characteristics by applying a recently developed GIS based methodology to inform electrification planning and strategies in Ethiopia. The paper illustrates two major aspects of energy planning; 1.) how the optimal electrification mix is influenced by a range of parameters ‚Äì including population density, existing and planned transmission networks and power plants, economic activities, tariffs for grid-based electricity, technology costs for mini-grid and off-grid systems, and fuel costs for consumers and 2.) how the electrification mix differs from location to location. For a certain level of energy access, on-grid connections would be optimal for the majority of the new connections in Ethiopia; grid extension constitutes the lowest cost option for approximately 93% of the newly electrified population in this modelling effort with 2030 as time horizon. However, there are some remote areas with low population density where a mini-grid (ca. 6%) or a stand-alone solution (ca. 1%) are the most economic options. Depending on local resource availability, these systems deploy varied combinations of solar, wind, hydro and diesel technologies.",72,,43478,GIS; Energy planning; Energy access,

The CE was followed by a contingent valuation (CV) question. Differences in willingness to pay (WTP) for the same filter design were tested between methods, as well as urban and rural samples. Results: The CV follow-up approach produces more conservative and statistically more efficient WTP values than the CE, with only limited indications of anchoring. The effect of the new filter technology on children with diarrhea is among the most important drivers behind choice behavior and WTP in both areas. The urban sample is willing to pay more in absolute terms than the rural sample irrespective of the valuation method. Rural households are more price sensitive, and willing to pay more in relative terms compared with disposable household income. Conclusion: A differentiated marketing strategy across rural and urban areas is expected to increase uptake and diffusion of the new filter technology.

Cleaner biomass stoves, however, perform poorly against the World Health Organization's indoor air quality guidelines. This has shifted the focus to systematic dissemination and implementation of cleaner cooking systems such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) among poor communities. Even when there is some uptake of LPG by poor communities, its sustained use has been low. Concurrent use of LPG with traditional biomass cookstoves compromises reductions in household air pollution and limits health and environmental dividends. Therefore understanding key drivers of adoption and sustained implementation of clean fuels among the poor is critical. There is a significant gap, however, in the research to understand determinants and sustained exclusive use of clean fuels in rural poor communities. Methods/design: Using a case control study design, this study will explore the impact of affordability, accessibility, and awareness on adoption and sustained use of LPG among rural poor communities of India. The study uses a multistage random sampling to collect primary data from 510 households. Case group or LPG adopters constitute 255 households while control group or non-LPG adopters constitute the remaining 255 households. The study will deploy sophisticated stove use monitoring sensors in each of the stoves in 100 case group households to monitor stove use and stacking behavior (using clean and traditional systems of cooking) of participants for 12 months. Moreover, this will be the first study to explore the impact of personal social networks striated by gender on LPG adoption. This study is guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) implementation science evaluation framework. Discussion: Lessons from this study will feed into a larger discussion on developing a pro-poor strategy to foster uptake and sustained use of cleaner cooking systems such as LPG. Understanding the determinants of adoption and sustained use of cleaner cooking systems through the RE-AIM framework will expand our insights on implementation of cleaner cooking systems among poor communities and will advance implementation science in the clean cooking sector. A thorough study of such implementation strategies is crucial to realize multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals on global health, climate change, and energy security. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).",75,1,,Adoption; Cleaner cooking systems; Gender-based networks; Implementation science; Implementation strategies; LPG; Re-aim; Stove Use Monitoring Systems; Sustained use,

K.",Harnessing fuel-energy from biomass for drudgery reduction in rural households,Asian Journal of Home Science,0973-4732,,http://www.researchjournal.co.in/online/AJHS.html,"Household sector is one of the largest users of energy in India, accounting for about 30 per cent of total energy consumption, thereby, reflecting the importance of this sector in total national energy scenario. Nearly all rural households and one-third of urban households do not use clean cooking fuel. It is well documented that about 80 per cent of the energy used in rural areas for cooking is derived from biomass, dung cakes and firewood. Women spend 4 to 6 hours of their productive time in fetching biomass/fuel-wood for cooking and carry it as a head-load. Children are also involved in collection of fuel-wood in their school hours. Use of loose biomass as fuel for cooking is the major cause of indoor air pollution in developing countries as it is used in poorly functional wood-stoves. Combustion of biomass leads to high levels of health damaging pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, benzene, aromatic hydro-carbons and many other toxic compounds. Exposure to smoke from burning of biomass fuel is responsible for several diseases such as acute respiratory infections, tuberculosis and asthma, low birth weight, and cataract and blindness, thereby, adversely affecting the health of women and children to a great extent. Therefore, in Indian households, energy problem is not only a problem of the scarcity of energy but also of inefficient combustion and related health problems. Briquetting and pelletizing is an appropriate technology for harnessing renewable fuel-energy from this huge stock of biomass. Conversion of biomass into pellets and burning it in improved pellet stoves can help to overcome the problem of inefficient combustion besides mitigating the health problems associated with smoke pollution. Improving access to this affordable, clean, smoke-free energy is critical for reducing women's drudgery and improving the quality of life in rural areas. This will ultimately result in maintaining sustainable health of the environment and the economy.",8,2,754-758,air pollutants; air quality; aromatic hydrocarbons; benzene; bioenergy; biofuels; biomass; briquetting; burning; carbon monoxide; case studies; cattle dung; children; combustion; cooking; energy consumption; formaldehyde; fuelwood; households; human diseases; indoor air pollution; nitrogen oxides; pelleting; pellets; public health; quality of life; renewable energy; rural areas; smoke; stoves; sustainability; technology; toxic substances; waste management; waste utilization; women,

Current projections show that within this transition, new jobs will be created, some eliminated and most others subjected to change. This article reports findings from interviews with a selection of twenty participants who are involved in the formation and/or deployment of green skills. The participants were asked about their perceptions of (1) how jobs are changing in the transition to a green economy (2) how are adult learners developing and using green skills, and (3) what are some of the main drivers and blockers to the development and use of green skills. The data are presented as vignettes from various positions of supply and demand within the emerging green economy. The findings of this study report that the organisations and the training providers are motivated to develop and/or deploy green jobs and green skills for a range of different reasons. These include the making of a favourable business case, environmental beliefs about conserving the finite resources of the planet and, for health and wellbeing reasons. Some blockers that have been identified are the initial capital outlay for any changes, and the need to address some inconsistencies that arise over time in the financial arrangements when trying to work out the business case. This has led the designers and contractors working in renewable energy to call for a level playing field with those who provide and utilise finite resources and non-renewable energy. Overall transition to a low carbon and green economy is shown to be supported and occurring with some limited success. However there is a need for further larger scale research into this area of skill formation and deployment. ¬© 2015, ADULT LEARNING AUSTRALIA INC.

It provides 14% of the world's primary energy and 30-90% of the primary energy supply in the developing world. Nearly 70-90% of the primary energy supply in Africa is derived from biomass sources. Of the biomass energy supply in Africa, some 90% is used in households with extremely wasteful traditional cookstoves that typically attain barely 5-15% efficiency. The low level of biomass fuel conversion efficiency is a leading cause of indoor pollution and respiratory diseases. It also generates needlessly large quantities of GHGs. In view of addressing these adverse impacts, many developing countries have initiated programmes for improvement of domestic cooking fuels and conversion efficiency. Such programmes have, in many countries, resulted in impressive improvements of cookstove efficiency, up to 30-40% in some cases. Improved biomass fuels, such as biogas and - more recently - producer gas, have been deployed in appropriately designed stoves. Several million stoves have been disseminated in Ethiopia and Kenya alone. But compared with the magnitude of biomass energy used in the household sector of the developing world, the overall effect of these efforts has not yet proved significant.

Ukraine (UA), Belarus, Moldova, etc.) are significantly dependent on energy imports, and require revitalization of their agricultural sectors and improvements in the state of the environment. Development of national bioenergy potentials can contribute to the solutions to these problems. However, EiTs face technical, political, financial, and capacity-based constraints in their transition to bioenergy. Biomass can potentially deliver 18% (1 EJ yr-1) in UA's energy balance while the current figure is only 0.7%. The bioenergy sector is not established in UA. This work identifies facilitating and constraining factors for the transition to agro-bioenergy in UA, and suggests strategies to pursue such transition. A conceptual framework - agro-biomass framework for organisation and action (ABF) - developed by the author applies a technology innovation system (TIS) approach, which is expanded to include four categories of analysis: actors and networks, natural resources, technical resources, and non-technical components. Seven TIS functions are analyzed in relation to each category within UA's bioenergy sector. The results are presented as constraining and facilitating factors for bioenergy in UA in relation to these functions. Strategies for the enhancement of each function are formulated, and recommendations to a variety of stakeholders to facilitate the transition to agro-bioenergy in UA are made. This work establishes pre-requisites for a legitimate agro-industrial bioenergy sector in UA and is unique for the UA and EiT context. New ABFs can be further applied in a variety of settings for the analysis of bioenergy initiatives and the degree of bioenergy development. ¬© 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",6,2,124-134,Bioenergy management; Economies in transition; Non-technical barriers to bioenergy; Straw; Ukraine; Agricultural sector; Belarus; Bio-energy; Bioenergy initiatives; Bioenergy potential; Conceptual frameworks; Energy imports; Non-technical barriers; Pre-requisites; Technical resources; Technology innovation; Innovation; International trade; Sugar industry; Artificial intelligence,

This study asks whether suggested policy interventions reflect the needs of stakeholders and examines how these needs vary between European regions. This consultation was performed through an online survey of 447 experts actively involved in bio-based research, industry, and governance across Europe. The majority of responses received were from stakeholders in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK which are examined in greater depth. Climate change was clearly an important driver for bio-based innovation as 86% of the respondents considered climate change to be a significant threat. There were clear differences between regions but also areas of consensus between stakeholders across the European regions surveyed. In particular there was consensus regarding the need for improved access to financial support and the need to ensure continuity of policy. The need to build investor confidence through demonstration of bio-based technologies, the provision of greater clarity regarding best conversion routes for specific feedstocks, and the need to promote a culture of industrial symbiosis were also regarded as important interventions. ¬© 2016 The Authors.

As fuelwood consumption in the country is expected to increase in the future, it is important to increase the supply of wood by sustainable use of the existing natural forests. Even if they are far from the centres of consumption, these are the only available reserves capable of supporting the Brazilian future fuelwood requirements. For this reason it is necessary to use advanced technology to convert the energy of wood efficiently into a form (such as electricity) to carry it to the centres of consumption. In addition, fuel plantations would be established in the available areas, mainly for specific uses, such as charcoal production for the pig-iron and steel industries.

Moreover, a series of semi-structured interviews as well as an interactive workshop was conducted which allowed us to place multiple stakeholder perspectives and experiences at the heart of the analysis to look at factors beyond the micro-system of the technology, and understand the broader socio-institutional context. Our analysis of enabling and hindering factors to biogas expansion identified opportunities for improving the design and implementation of policy, finance and technology measures. These findings are relevant not only for the Indonesian context, but also for other developing countries that are increasingly investing in transitioning to low-carbon energy futures. ¬© 2019 The Authors",122,,457-465,Biogas; Co-benefits; Energy; Low-carbon; Participatory approach; Developing countries; Factor analysis; Fossil fuels; Co benefits; Design and implementations; Institutional contexts; Low carbon; Multiple stakeholders; Semi structured interviews; alternative energy; bioenergy; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; energy resource; fossil fuel; integrated approach; policy implementation; resource development; rural population; Bali; Indonesia; Lesser Sunda Islands; Sunda Isles,

Deforestation threatens to alter the supply of biomass available to households. We use remote sensing and longitudinal household data to understand the relationship between agriculture-led deforestation and household energy choices in Uganda. Our hypothesis is that rapid deforestation and associated biomass stock depletion affects the type, quantity, and quality of fuels used by households. We analyze land use changes characterizing deforestation and forest degradation at 500-m spatial resolution. Using two waves of survey data for 451 households, we describe changes in the type, quantity, and source of biomass fuels used. We estimate net losses of 4.51 billion kg or 26% of available air-dry biomass over an 8-year period in 5-km buffers surrounding the study villages. We estimate a series of panel mixed-effect regression models to test whether reduction in biomass availability affects fuel choice and find that lower biomass availability is associated with an increase in fuel sourced from non-forest areas, use of crop residues as a cooking fuel, and time to collect fuel. We find that households are transitioning from fuelwood sourced from forests to fuelwood sourced from areas with much less available and lower quality biomass. We find limited evidence that investment in tree planting is replacing natural forests as a source of high quality biomass fuel. Our findings have implications for both human and environmental health particularly in biomass dependent and population dense settings in sub-Saharan Africa.",105,,43709,,

In such an economy, the proportion of traditional and modern fuels in the â€˜energy basketâ€™ of rural households depends as much on non-cash factors as on cash income, which vary considerably among the rural socioeconomic strata. A large field study was conducted in rural Karnataka, a state in southern India, which uncovers the relations between the energy situations of the rural social classes and their access to labour, land, cash and physical assets. Of equal significance are regional variations in ecology, rainfall and irrigation. The study's principal focus is the rural household, but it also includes some analysis of the energy dimensions in agricultural activities and small-scale rural services. Eight villages were covered by the survey, one in each district, carefully selected to reflect the geographic, climatic, biomass-resource and socio-economic features of Karnataka. In each village an average of 55 households were studied in depth, making up a total of 450 households. Clear and marked differentiations are uncovered between the rural social classes in various aspects of energy production, purchase, sale and consumption, as well as in labour and cash inputs into the energy flows. To cite but two major examples here: the top strata's access to traditional biomass fuels is about a third more than the bottom strata's (on average 630 as compared with 500 kg per capita per annum); in modern fuels, taking electricity as one of the main types, the skewing is very pronounced, with the top being able to afford 12 times more than the bottom (on average 60 as compared with 5 kW h per capita per annum). It is found that traditional forms of biomass are still the dominant type of energy for all rural strata, and that only the rural middle class can be said to have begun the transition towards modern fuels, although its consumption of modern fuels is still negligibly small in absolute terms. The study reveals that the rural middle class faces no energy crisis, while the â€˜intermediateâ€™ class of the small peasantry is just about managing to make ends meet in energy terms. In contrast to this, the rural wage labour class continues to remain in a state of energy crisis.",8,3,181-190,Biomass; fuelwood; residues; energy; fuel-transition; labour; households; classes; rural; India,

Most interventions have been unable to successfully address this unmet need due to various community and health system level factors. Identifying these inhibiting and enabling factors prior to implementation of interventions forms the basis for planning efforts to increase met needs. This qualitative study was part of the formative phase of a larger research project that aimed to develop an intervention to increase met needs for contraception through community and health system participation. The specific study component reported here explores barriers and enablers to family planning and contraceptive services provision and utilisation at community and health systems levels. Methods: Twelve focus group discussions were conducted with community members (n = 114) and two with healthcare providers (n = 19). Ten in-depth interviews were held with key stakeholders. The study was conducted in Kabwe district, Zambia. Interviews/discussions were translated and transcribed verbatim. Data were coded and organised using NVivo 10 (QSR international), and were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Health systems barriers include long distances to healthcare facilities, stock-outs of preferred methods, lack of policies facilitating contraceptive provision in schools, and undesirable provider attitudes. Community level barriers comprise women's experience with contraceptive side effects, myths, rumours and misconceptions, societal stigma, and negative traditional and religious beliefs. On the other hand, health systems enablers consist of political will from government to expand contraceptive services access, integration of contraceptive services, provision of couples counselling, and availability of personnel to offer basic methods mix. Functional community health system structures, community desire to delay pregnancy, and knowledge of contraceptive services are enablers at a community level. Conclusions: These study findings highlight key community and health systems factors that should be considered by policy, program planners and implementers in the design and implementation of family planning and contraceptive services programmes, to ensure sustained uptake and increased met needs for contraceptive methods and services. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).",18,1,,"Barriers; Community; Contraception; Enablers; Family planning; Health system; contraceptive agent; adult; attitude to health; clinical trial; community care; counseling; female; government; health care delivery; health care personnel; human; induced abortion; information processing; male; medical care; multicenter study; pregnancy; procedures; qualitative research; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; utilization; Zambia; Abortion, Induced; Community Health Services; Contraceptive Agents; Delivery of Health Care; Family Planning Services; Focus Groups; Government Programs; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Medical Assistance",

Dengue control activities are mostly outbreak driven, and still lack systematic interventions while most people have poor health-related knowledge and practices. Mobile Short Message Service (SMS) represents a low-cost health promotion intervention that can enhance the dengue prevention knowledge and practices of the affected communities. This study aimed to explore the acceptability, appropriateness, and effectiveness of mobile SMS intervention in improving dengue control practices.MethodsThis study was an implementation research that used mixed-methods design with intervention. A total of 300 households were divided into three groups, i.e. one control group, one dengue prevention leaflet (DPL) only intervention group and one DPL with mobile SMS intervention group (DPL+SMS). We used a structured questionnaire to collect information regarding participants' knowledge and practice of dengue prevention. We conducted in-depth interviews with key informants to measure acceptability and appropriateness of intervention. Mean difference with standard deviation (SD), one-way ANOVA, paired t-test and regression analyses were used to assess the effectiveness of the interventions. Thematic analysis was used to assess the acceptability, and appropriateness as well as barriers and enablers of the intervention.ResultsThe DPL+SMS intervention produced significantly higher mean knowledge difference (32.713.7 SD vs. 13.3 +/- 8.8 SD) and mean practice difference (27.9 +/- 11.4 SD vs 4.9 +/- 5.4 SD) compared to the DPL only group (p =0.000). Multivariate analysis showed that the DPL+SMS intervention was effective to increase knowledge by 28.6 points and practice by 28.1 points compared to the control group. The intervention was perceived as acceptable and appropriate by the study participants and key stakeholders. Perceived barriers included reaching private network users and poor network in geographically remote areas, while enabling factors included mobile phone penetration, low cost, and shared responsibility.Conclusions Mobile SMS is an effective, acceptable and appropriate health intervention to improve dengue prevention practices in communities. This intervention can be adopted as a promising tool for health education against dengue and other diseases.",19,1,,Implementation research; Effectiveness; Acceptability; Appropriateness; Dengue prevention; Mobile SMS; Nepal; HEALTH-EDUCATION; PHONES,

Implementation science offers tools to study complex interventions, understand barriers to implementation, and generate evidence of affordability, scalability, and sustainability. Such evidence could be used to convince policy-makers and donors to invest in implementation. However, the utility of implementation research depends on its rigor and replicability. Our objectives were to systematically review implementation studies of health-related stigma reduction interventions in LMICs and critically assess the reporting of implementation outcomes and intervention descriptions. PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were searched for evaluations of stigma reduction interventions in LMICs reporting at least one implementation outcome. Study- and intervention-level characteristics were abstracted. The quality of reporting of implementation outcomes was assessed using a five-item rubric, and the comprehensiveness of intervention description and specification was assessed using the 12-item Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR). A total of 35 eligible studies published between 2003 and 2017 were identified; of these, 20 (57%) used qualitative methods, 32 (91%) were type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation studies, and 29 (83%) were evaluations of once-off or pilot implementations. No studies adopted a formal theoretical framework for implementation research. Acceptability (20, 57%) and feasibility (14, 40%) were the most frequently reported implementation outcomes. The quality of reporting of implementation outcomes was low. The 35 studies evaluated 29 different interventions, of which 18 (62%) were implemented across sub-Saharan Africa, 20 (69%) focused on stigma related to HIV/AIDS, and 28 (97%) used information or education to reduce stigma. Intervention specification and description was uneven. Implementation science could support the dissemination of stigma reduction interventions in LMICs, though usage to date has been limited. Theoretical frameworks and validated measures have not been used, key implementation outcomes like cost and sustainability have rarely been assessed, and intervention processes have not been presented in detail. Adapted frameworks, new measures, and increased LMIC-based implementation research capacity could promote the rigor of future stigma implementation research, helping the field deliver on the promise of stigma reduction interventions worldwide.",17,,,Stigma; intervention; implementation science; systematic review; low-; and middle-income countries; HIV-RELATED STIGMA; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; MENTAL-HEALTH; CONSOLIDATED FRAMEWORK; COMMUNITY INTERVENTION; COMPLEX; INTERVENTIONS; PREVENTION; CHILDREN; IMPACT,

Prior to the implementation, a stakeholder analysis was undertaken to assess and map stakeholders' interests, influence/power and position in relation to the interventions; their views regarding the success and sustainability; and how this research can influence policy formulation in the country. Methods: A stakeholder analysis was carried out in March 2011 at national level and in four districts of Eastern Uganda where the proposed interventions would be conducted. At the national level, four key informant interviews were conducted with the ministry of health representative, Member of Parliament, and development partners. District health team members were interviewed and also engaged in a workshop; and at community level, twelve focus group discussions were conducted among women, men and motorcycle transporters. Results: This analysis revealed that district and community level stakeholders were high level supporters of the proposed interventions but not drivers. At community level the mothers, their spouses and transporters were of low influence due to the limited funds they possessed. National level and district stakeholders believed that the intervention is costly and cannot be affordably scaled up. They advised the study team to mobilize and sensitize the communities to contribute financially from the start in order to enhance sustainability beyond the study period. Stakeholders believed that the proposed interventions will influence policy through modeling on how to improve the quality of maternal/newborn health services, male involvement, and improved accessibility of services. Conclusion: Most of the stakeholders interviewed were supporters of the proposed maternal and newborn care intervention because of the positive benefits of the intervention. The analysis highlighted stakeholder concerns that will be included in the final project design and that could also be useful in countries of similar setting that are planning to set up programmes geared at increasing access to maternal and new born interventions. Key among these concerns was the need to use both human and financial resources that are locally available in the community, to address supply side barriers that influence access to maternal and child healthcare. Research to policy translation, therefore, will require mutual trust, continued dialogue and engagement of the researchers, implementers and policy makers to enable scale up. ¬© 2013 Namazzi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",13,,,"Eastern Uganda; Future health systems; Maternal and newborn health; Stakeholder analysis; adult; article; child health; cost; female; health care access; health care policy; health service; human; interview; male; maternal welfare; Uganda; Community Health Planning; Community-Based Participatory Research; Focus Groups; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Health Services; Pregnancy; Qualitative Research; Transportation",

Few randomized controlled interventions of cookstoves (biomass or otherwise) have quantitatively characterized changes in exposure and indicators of cardiometabolic health, a growing and understudied burden in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Ideally, the solution is to transition households to clean cooking, such as with electric or liquefied petroleum gas stoves; however, those unable to afford or to access these options will continue to burn biomass for the foreseeable future. Wood-burning cookstove designs such as the Justa (incorporating an engineered combustion zone and chimney) have the potential to substantially reduce air pollution exposures. Previous cookstove intervention studies have been limited by stove types that did not substantially reduce exposures and/or by low cookstove adoption and sustained use, and few studies have incorporated community-engaged approaches to enhance the intervention. Methods/design: We conducted an individual-level, stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial with the Justa cookstove intervention in rural Honduras. We enrolled 230 female primary cooks who were not pregnant, non-smoking, aged 24-59 years old, and used traditional wood-burning cookstoves at baseline. A community advisory board guided survey development and communication with participants, including recruitment and retention strategies. Over a 3-year study period, participants completed 6 study visits approximately 6 months apart. Half of the women received the Justa after visit 2 and half after visit 4. At each visit, we measured 24-h gravimetric personal and kitchen fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations, qualitative and quantitative cookstove use and adoption metrics, and indicators of cardiometabolic health. The primary health endpoints were blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and glycated hemoglobin. Overall study goals are to explore barriers and enablers of new cookstove adoption and sustained use, compare health endpoints by assigned cookstove type, and explore the exposure-response associations between PM2.5 and indicators of cardiometabolic health. Discussion: This trial, utilizing an economically feasible, community-vetted cookstove and evaluating endpoints relevant for the major causes of morbidity and mortality in LMICs, will provide critical information for household air pollution stakeholders globally.

A transition is needed towards culturally sensitive services to overcome barriers to make cure and care accessible for elderly immigrants. We developed an intervention programme in which ethnic community health workers act as liaisons between immigrant elderly and local health care and social welfare services. In this study we evaluate the effectiveness and the implementation of this intervention programme. Methods/design: In a quasi experimental design, the effectiveness of introduction of community health workers, health needs assessment, and follow-up intervention programme will be evaluated in three (semi) urban residential areas in the Netherlands and compared with a control group. Community health workers are selected from local ethnic communities and trained for the intervention. Data on health perception, quality of life, and care consumption are collected at baseline and after the intervention programme. Elderly's informal care givers are included to examine caregiver burden. The primary outcome is use of health care and social welfare facilities by the elderly. Secondary outcomes are quality of life and functional impairments. The target number of participants is 194 immigrant elderly: 97 for the intervention group and 97 for the control group. Implementation of the intervention programme will be examined with focus groups and data registration of community health worker activities. Discussion: This study can contribute to the improvement of care for elderly immigrants by developing culturally sensitive care whereby they actively participate. To enable a successful transition, proper identification and recruitment of community health workers is required. Taking this into account, the study aims to provide evidence for an approach to improve the care and access to care for elderly immigrants.

If the health benefits of food availability policies are to be realised, interventions that are effective need to be implemented at scale, across an entire population of schools. This study aims to assess the potential effectiveness of an intervention in increasing the implementation, at scale, of a healthy canteen policy by Australian primary schools. Methods: A non-controlled before and after study was conducted in primary schools located in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia. Schools received a multi-component intervention adapted from a previous efficacious and cost-effective randomised control trial. The primary trial outcome was the proportion of canteen menus compliant with the state healthy canteen policy, assessed via menu audit at baseline and follow-up by dietitians. Secondary outcomes included policy reach and adoption and maintenance policy implementation. Results: Of the 173 schools eligible for inclusion in the trial, 168 provided menus at baseline and 157 menus were collected at follow-up. At follow-up, multiple imputation analysis found 35% (55/157) of schools compared to 17% (29/168) at baseline (OR = 2.8 (1.6-4.7), p = < 0.001) had menus compliant with the state healthy canteen policy. As an assessment of the impact of the intervention on policy reach, canteen manager and principal knowledge of the policy increased from 64% (n = 76) and 38% (n = 44) respectively at baseline to 69% (n = 89) and 60% (n = 70) at follow-up (p = 0.393, p = 0.026).

However, loss of driving privileges can dramatically reduce independence and quality of life for older members of the community. The aim of this trial is to examine the effectiveness of a safe transport program for drivers aged 75 years and older at reducing driving exposure but maintaining mobility. Methods and design. A randomised trial will be conducted, involving 380 drivers aged 75 years and older, resident in urban and semi-rural areas of North-West Sydney. The intervention is an education program based on the Knowledge Enhances Your Safety (KEYS) program, adapted for the Australian context. Driving experience will be measured objectively using an in-vehicle monitoring device which includes a global positioning system (GPS) to assess driving exposure and an accelerometer to detect rapid deceleration events. Participation will be assessed using the Keele Assessment of Participation (KAP). Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis; the primary outcomes include driving exposure, rapid deceleration events and scores for KAP. Secondary outcomes include self-reported measures of driving, socialisation, uptake of alternative forms of transport, depressive symptoms and mood. A detailed process evaluation will be conducted, including examination of the delivery of the program and uptake of alternative forms of transport. A subgroup analysis is planned for drivers with reduced function as characterized by established cut-off scores on the Drivesafe assessment tool. Discussion. This randomised trial is powered to provide an objective assessment of the efficacy of an individually tailored education and alternative transportation program to promote safety of older drivers but maintain mobility.

Further, health conditions resulting from household air pollution (HAP) are responsible for approximately 3.9 million premature deaths each year. Though transition away from traditional biomass stoves is projected curb the health effects of HAP by mitigating exposure, the benefits of newer clean cookstove technologies can only be fully realized if use of these new stoves is exclusive and sustained. However, the conditions under which individuals adopt and sustain use of clean cookstoves is not well understood. Methods: The Enhancing LPG Adoption in Ghana (ELAG) study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial employing a factorial intervention design. The first component is a behavior change intervention based on the Risks, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities, and Self-regulation (RANAS) model. This intervention seeks to align these five behavioral factors with clean cookstove adoption and sustained use. A second intervention is access-related and will improve LPG availability by offering a direct-delivery refueling service. These two interventions will be integrated via a factorial design whereby 27 communities are assigned to one of the following: the control arm, the educational intervention, the delivery, or a combined intervention. Intervention allocation is determined by a covariate-constrained randomization approach. After intervention, approximately 900 households' individual fuel use is tracked for 12 months via iButton stove use monitors. Analysis will include hierarchical linear models used to compare intervention households' fuel use to control households. Discussion: Literature to-date demonstrates that recipients of improved cookstoves rarely completely adopt the new technology. Instead, they often practice partial adoption (fuel stacking). Consequently, interventions are needed to influence adoption patterns and simultaneously to understand drivers of fuel adoption. Ensuring uptake, adoption, and sustained use of improved cookstove technologies can then lead to HAP-reductions and consequent improvements in public health.

This urbanizing trend has been accompanied by an increasing number of people living in urban poor communities and slums. Lower immunization coverage is found in poorer urban dwellers in many contexts. This study aims to identify factors associated with immunization coverage in poor urban areas and slums, and to identify interventions to improve coverage. Methods: We conducted a systematic review, searching Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Web of Science and The Cochrane Database with broad search terms for studies published between 2000 and 2016. Results: Of 4872 unique articles, 327 abstracts were screened, leading to 63 included studies: 44 considering factors and 20 evaluating interventions (one in both categories) in 16 low or middle-income countries. A wide range of socio-economic characteristics were associated with coverage in different contexts. Recent rural-urban migration had a universally negative effect. Parents commonly reported lack of awareness of immunization importance and difficulty accessing services as reasons for under-immunization of their children. Physical distance to clinics and aspects of service quality also impacted uptake. We found evidence of effectiveness for interventions involving multiple components, especially if they have been designed with community involvement. Outreach programmes were effective where physical distance was identified as a barrier. Some evidence was found for the effective use of SMS (text) messaging services, community-based education programmes and financial incentives, which warrant further evaluation. No interventions were identified that provided services to migrants from rural areas. Conclusion: Different factors affect immunization coverage in different urban poor and slum contexts. Immunization services should be designed in collaboration with slum-dwelling communities, considering the local context. Interventions should be designed and tested to increase immunization in migrants from rural areas. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).",17,1,,Immunization; Low-income; Slum; Urban; Vaccine; developing country; female; health education; human; male; poverty; statistics and numerical data; urban population; urbanization; vaccination; Developing Countries; Humans; Poverty Areas,

However, cancer screening uptake is consistently lower in this group than in the native-born populations. As a first step towards developing an effective cancer screening intervention program targeting Asian women, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review, without geographic, language or date limitations, to update current knowledge on the effectiveness of existing intervention strategies to enhance breast and cervical screening uptake in Asian women. Methods. This study systematically reviewed studies published as of January 2010 to synthesize knowledge about effectiveness of cancer screening interventions targeting Asian women. Fifteen multidisciplinary peer-reviewed and grey literature databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Results: The results of our systematic review were reported in accordance with the PRISMA Statement. Of 37 selected intervention studies, only 18 studies included valid outcome measures (i.e. self-reported or recorded receipt of mammograms or Pap smear). 11 of the 18 intervention studies with valid outcome measures used multiple intervention strategies to target individuals in a specific Asian ethnic group. This observed pattern of intervention design supports the hypothesis that employing a combination of multiple strategies is more likely to be successful than single interventions. The effectiveness of community-based or workplace-based group education programs increases when additional supports, such as assistance in scheduling/attending screening and mobile screening services are provided. Combining cultural awareness training for health care professionals with outreach workers who can help healthcare professionals overcome language and cultural barriers is likely to improve cancer screening uptake. Media campaigns and mailed culturally sensitive print materials alone may be ineffective in increasing screening uptake. Intervention effectiveness appears to vary with ethnic population, methods of program delivery, and study setting. Conclusions: Despite some limitations, our review has demonstrated that the effectiveness of existing interventions to promote breast and cervical cancer screening uptake in Asian women may hinge on a variety of factors, such as type of intervention and study population characteristics. While some studies demonstrated the effectiveness of certain intervention programs, the cost effectiveness and long-term sustainability of these programs remain questionable. When adopting an intervention program, it is important to consider the impacts of social-and cultural factors specific to the Asian population on cancer screening uptake. Future research is needed to develop new interventions and tools, and adopt vigorous study design and evaluation methodologies to increase cancer screening among Asian women to promote population health and health equity. ¬© 2012 Lu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",12,1,,Asian; breast tumor; early diagnosis; female; health promotion; human; methodology; review; statistics; uterine cervix tumor; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Breast Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms,

A systematic review was conducted to determine the extent of equity of CHW programmes and to identify intervention design factors which influence equity of health outcomes. Methods: In accordance with our published protocol, we systematically searched eight databases from 2004 to 2014 for quantitative and qualitative studies which assessed access, utilisation, quality or community empowerment following introduction of a CHW programme according to equity stratifiers (place of residence, gender, socio-economic position and disability). Thirty four papers met inclusion criteria. A thematic framework was applied and data extracted and managed, prior to charting and thematic analysis. Results: To our knowledge this is the first systematic review that describes the extent of equity within CHW programmes and identifies CHW intervention design features which influence equity. CHW programmes were found to promote equity of access and utilisation for community health by reducing inequities relating to place of residence, gender, education and socio-economic position. CHWs can also contribute towards more equitable uptake of referrals at health facility level. There was no clear evidence for equitable quality of services provided by CHWs and limited information regarding the role of the CHW in generating community empowerment to respond to social determinants of health. Factors promoting greater equity of CHW services include recruitment of most poor community members as CHWs, close proximity of services to households, pre-existing social relationship with CHW, provision of home-based services, free service delivery, targeting of poor households, strengthened referral to facility, sensitisation and mobilisation of community. However, if CHW programmes are not well planned some of the barriers faced by clients at health facility level can replicate at community level. Conclusions: CHWs promote equitable access to health promotion, disease prevention and use of curative services at household level. However, care must be taken by policymakers and implementers to take into account factors which can influence the equity of services during planning and implementation of CHW programmes. ¬© 2016 McCollum et al.",16,1,,Close-to-community provider; Community health worker; Equity; Inequity; Systematic review; community care; demography; health auxiliary; health care delivery; health care quality; health promotion; home visit; human; organization and management; patient referral; qualitative research; sex difference; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; Community Health Services; Community Health Workers; Delivery of Health Care; Health Services Accessibility; House Calls; Humans; Quality of Health Care; Referral and Consultation; Residence Characteristics; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors,

Improved cookstoves are one of few available interventions, but achieving equity in cookstove access has been challenging. Therefore, innovative approaches are needed. To evaluate a project designed to motivate adoption of locally-produced, ceramic cookstoves (upesi jiko) in an impoverished, rural African population, we assessed the perceived benefits of the cookstoves (in monetary and time-savings terms), the rate of cookstove adoption, and the equity of adoption. Methods: The project was conducted in 60 rural Kenyan villages in 2008 and 2009. Baseline (n = 1250) and follow-up (n = 293) surveys and a stove-tracking database were analyzed. Results: At baseline, nearly all respondents used wood (95%) and firepits (99%) for cooking; 98% desired smoke reductions. Households with upesi jiko subsequently spent <100 Kenyan Shillings/week on firewood more often (40%) than households without upesi jiko (20%) (p = 0.0002). There were no significant differences in the presence of children <2 years of age in households using upesi jiko (48%) or three-stone stoves (49%) (p = 0.88); children 2–5 years of age were less common in households using upesi jiko versus three-stone stoves (46% and 69%, respectively) (p = 0.0001). Vendors installed 1,124 upesi jiko in 757 multi-family households in 18 months; 68% of these transactions involved incentives for vendors and purchasers. Relatively few (<10%) upesi jiko were installed in households of women in the youngest age quartile (<22 years) or among households in the poorest quintile. Conclusions: Our strategy of training of local vendors, appropriate incentives, and product integration effectively accelerated cookstove adoption into a large number of households. The strategy also created opportunities to reinforce health messages and promote cookstoves sales and installation. However, the project’s overall success was diminished by inequitable and incomplete adoption by households with the lowest socioeconomic status and young children present. Additional evaluations of similar strategies will be needed to determine whether our strategy can be applied equitably elsewhere, and whether reductions in fuel use, household air pollution, and the incidence of respiratory diseases will follow adoption of improved cookstoves.",12,1,359,,

While rural communities are shifting to modern fuels such as LPG and electrical energy for cooking, the International Energy Agency estimates that in the absence of new policies, the number of people relying on solid biomass will increase to over 2.7 billion by the year 2030 because of population growth, which calls for higher adoption rate of improved biomass cookstoves. This article highlights the key barriers to adoption of improved cookstoves, sharing experiences from the field in South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa. More emphasis on technical design of stoves to achieve higher thermal efficiency and lack of sufficient attention to consumer perspectives such as user-friendliness, purchasing capacity, income variability of rural households as well as to local capacity development of market players and stove builders create the dissemination challenge.

This article addresses this gap by analyzing global patterns of market openings for wind, solar PV, and biomass, focusing on the role of private project developers in developing countries. We use a mixed method design, based on a newly merged dataset encompassing eighty countries, and on interviews with pioneering project developers. Results highlight how patterns in market openings are shaped considerably by technology characteristics. Further, empirical results show international private developers are a key first mover in many developing countries. We explore drivers for this internationalization trend, including the impact of international developers' home country policies and the accumulation of tacit knowledge from home country markets for market openings abroad.

Methods: The study examined records for 10,287 two year olds between 1999 and 2002 using an ecological study design. The first step consisted of simple rate calculations to determine the total, complete, up-to-date and not up-to-date immunization rates for the city of Saskatoon and in each residential neighbourhood. Quantitative neighbourhood-level data were then used to determine if neighbourhood variables could significantly contribute to the variation in immunization coverage. Results: The findings revealed MMR/MR immunization rates were relatively stable between 1999 and 2002. However, significant disparities were found at the neighbourhood level, with areas of social and economic disadvantage having lower rates of total, complete, and up-to-date immunization uptake compared to areas of greater social and economic wealth. Multivariate linear regression revealed 80.6% of variation in up-to-date immunization uptake in Saskatoon could be explained by the proportion of single mothers and vehicles per capita in the neighbourhood.

Based on a systematic review of the advances in China's transportation infrastructure over the last 60 years, this paper explores the main drivers of transportation development, including national policy, transportation structure, investment efficiency, and technological innovation. Analysis shows that China's comprehensive transportation infrastructure construction since 1949 can be divided into five stages initiated by these drivers, which correspond to four transition modes: policy transition, structural transition, efficiency transition, and technology transition. The transition path of China's transportation development shows that the dominant factors have changed, and the interval for each transition has shortened. With the implementation of the '12th Five-Year Plan', China's transportation infrastructure construction is showing some new characteristics and facing a new development transition.

Adoption of bioenergy is perceived as an opportunity to develop alternatives to fossil fuels, to foster economic development and to meet international commitments to reduce greenhouse gases. However, such opportunities are accompanied by concerns such as the effect of biofuel production on deforestation rates - concerns that may be addressed through policy instruments and proper program design. Therefore, this country report contains an analysis of the legal and institutional frameworks related to Mexico's bioenergy sector. Practical experience with programmes and activities related to biofuels in Mexico is very limited. Therefore, the present report concentrates on analysing the provisions found in policies, laws and regulations, rather than on assessing project implementation and past practice. The report first examines the regulatory and institutional framework related to biofuel production and its use in Mexico, and then presents the policy framework for biofuel promotion in Mexico. Mexico's legal framework is well defined. It is composed of three normative levels: the Constitution; statutory law issued by the federal and local legislatures; and administrative provisions that include regulations issued by the federal executive power and other rules created by administrative agencies, such as technical norms, directives and other sector-specific binding instruments. The policy framework is a top-down structure with national plans at the top; these are linked to several sector and ministerial plans, which are ultimately linked to specific programmes. These programmes include strategies and subprogrammes that need Abstract to be developed in order to target feedstock, production, trade and sustainability objectives such as: sustainable production of feedstocks for biofuel production; establishment of a national programme for biofuel research and technology development; design of system-product chains; investment plans; employment creation in rural areas; contribution to increased reconversion and productive diversification of the primary sectors; and contribution to the preservation of natural resources and biodiversity, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, our analysis indicates that most of these programmes and plans are not mature. Only a few sets of laws specifically target biofuels, most of which are mainly directed towards the energy sector and ignore the potential impacts on deforestation. Even the most recently published programmes are, in effect, only a list of guidelines, structured under the logic of a business plan (vision, mission, objectives and actions). Mexico has documented lists of tasks and goals; however, documentation containing programme details or in-depth analyses of plans (beyond simple statements) is not fully available. In addition, there is need for long-term planning; for example, the Bioenergy Penetration Programme refers its strategic vision to the year 2012. Mexico is several steps behind other Latin American countries, particularly Brazil, regarding the establishment of a well-developed and stable biofuels market. Further efforts are required in the areas of agriculture and environment if the largescale development of biofuels is to be promoted in Mexico whilst avoiding deforestation and accruing a true mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Clear provisions and integrated mechanisms that foster the roles of the forestry and agriculture sectors in developing bioenergy whilst avoiding environmental damage have yet to be put into practice.",,63,vii-pp,bioenergy; biofuels; deforestation; economic development; emission; energy policy; feedstocks; fossil fuels; greenhouse gases; regulations; renewable energy; sustainability,

The South Korean governments set the goal to increase urban energy self-sufficiency through renewable energy generation and implemented various urban energy projects. However, the outcome of those urban green energy projects showed a varying degree of success. While the top-down approach led by the government facilitated the spread of urban green energy strategies in a short period of time, it also showed some drawbacks, such as the gap of willingness between the central government and the local governments and low level of community involvement. Although the importance of citizen participation in the transition to urban energy self-sufficiency has been emphasized in a rhetoric, energy projects that residents played a key role were rare in Korea. The urban energy transition in the low carbon green city projects needs to be supplemented by reinforced bottom-up approaches with the momentum from local governments as well as active citizen participation during the planning and implementation process.

However, capturing this changing role through national-based analyses is challenging due to the global nature of fossil fuel demand and resulting trade patterns. This article sets out the limitations of existing national-scale decarbonization analyses in adequately capturing global conditions and explores how the introduction of a global modelling framework could provide vital insights, particularly for those countries that are dependent on fossil fuel exports or imports. The article shows that fossil fuel use will significantly decline by 2050, although gas will have an important transition role. This leaves large fossil fuel exporters exposed, the extent of which is determined by mitigation action in different regions and especially by the pathways adopted by the larger Asian economies. We find that global-scale models provide critical insights that complement the more detailed national analyses and should play a stronger role in informing deep decarbonization pathways (DDPs). They also provide an important basis for exploring key uncertainties around technology uptake, mitigation rates and how this plays out in the demand for fossil fuels. However, use of global models also calls for improved representation of country specifics in global models, which can oversimplify national economic and political realities. Using both model scales provides important insights that are complementary but that can challenge the other's orthodoxy. However, neither can replace the other's strengths. Policy relevance: In recent years, how global fossil fuel markets will evolve under different climate regimes has been subject to much debate and analysis. This debate includes whether investments in fossil fuel production still make sense or will be exposed in the future to liabilities associated with high carbon prices. This is important for governments who need to develop coherent policy in relation to fossil fuel sectors and their role as drivers of economic growth and in providing for domestic energy needs. This article argues that national analyses need to be fully cognizant of the global-scale transition, which can be informed by using a multi-scale modelling approach. ¬© 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",16,,S92-S109,decarbonization; energy modelling scale; fossil fuel production; fossil fuel trade; emission control; energy market; environmental economics; fossil fuel; global trade; trade flow; Asia,

We examine how core assumptions concerning the roles of the nation state, carbon markets and finance and technology in international climate policy are being challenged by the realities of how transitions in the energy systems are unfolding. Drawing on the critical region of sub-Saharan Africa, we examine the potential for international climate policy to foster new trajectories towards decarbonization. Policy relevance The international regime for climate policy has been in place for some twenty years. Despite significant changes in the landscape of energy systems and drivers of global GHG emissions over this time, the core principles and tools remain relatively stable‚Äìnational governments, carbon markets, project-based climate finance and the transfer of technological hardware. Given the diversity of actors and drivers and the limited direct reach and influence of international climate policy, however, there is an urgent need to consider how the climate regime can best support the embryonic transitions that are slowly taking form around the world. To do this effectively requires a more nuanced understanding of the role of the state in governing these transitions beyond the notion of a cohesive state serving as rule-enforcer and transition manager. It also requires a broader view of technology, not just as hardware that is transferred, but as a set of practices and networks of expertise and enabling actors. Likewise, though markets have an important role to play as vehicles for achieving broader ends, they are not an end in themselves. Finally on finance, while acknowledging the important role of climate aid, often as a multiplier or facilitator of more ambitious private flows, it is critical to differentiate between the types of finance required for different transitions, many of which will not be counted under, or directed by, the climate regime. In sum, the (low-) carbon economy is being built in ways and in numerous sites that the climate regime needs to be cognizant of and engage with productively, and this may require fundamental reconsideration of the building blocks of the international climate regime. ¬© 2016 The Author(s).

While this rivalry may come from imports, the development of local capabilities and productive capacity for rivalry, including by black industrialists in the South African context, means understanding the barriers to entry that local producers must overcome. Barriers to entry are also critical for the correct balance between the risks of over-and under-enforcement and are one reason why it has been recommended that countries should adopt different standards for competition evaluation. This chapter draws on studies of barriers to entry in different markets in South Africa to consider the nature and extent of these barriers and the implications for competition policy.

Refugees generally have limited access to modern cooking solutions. Most either depend on insufficient humanitarian agency handouts of 'in-kind' firewood or have to travel long distances to collect firewood. There is significant potential for private-sector engagement in this context - which, though largely overlooked to date, could result in win-win scenarios for all stakeholders. Refugee camps and other displacement settings present opportunities for private-sector cooking fuel companies to expand their customer bases, with the added advantage for vendors of offering concentrated demand and scope for economies of scale. For the Kakuma refugee camp complex in Kenya, the Moving Energy Initiative (MEI) decided to engage with the private sector directly. The MEI requested expressions of interest from local private-sector companies for expanding sales and distribution of fuels in the complex through a concession. The winning company (National Oil Corporation of Kenya) is to receive a prize of $50,000 for its proposed concession to supply liquefied petroleum gas both to refugees in the Kakuma complex and to the surrounding host community. The MEI also conducted interviews with various stakeholders in other contexts and countries who are engaged in efforts to develop market-based approaches to providing clean, fuel-efficient cooking solutions to refugees. Based on the interviews and the concession process, the MEI recommends greater donor investment and longer-term guaranteed funding for cooking interventions. This is needed to allow sufficient time to build sustainable markets and secure the requisite engagement and investments from the private sector. Larger, longer-term investments by the private sector - supported through partnerships with donors and humanitarian agencies - in infrastructure and demand creation (both in and outside the refugee community) can reduce the price of alternative solutions and support a gradual transition away from subsidies.",,,46-pp,concessions; cooking; development aid; fuels; liquid petroleum gas; private investment; private sector; refugees; subsidies,

This study examines the factors surrounding the decision to not adopt a technology and whether certain factors exert differing effects on individuals in particular ways such that concurrent factors could be identified to develop a classification of the specific types of non-adoption behavior. Utilizing inhibitor theory and the symbolic adoption model as a foundational framework for the different types of non-adoption, we posit that different types of non-adoption exist which is demonstrated by determining the perceptions towards technology that coalesce around different types of non-adoption. We conducted a two-phase investigation into nonadoption with two goals in mind: 1) identify and explore specific factors of the IT that are associated with the rejection decision and are distinct from the adoption decision, and 2) determine the extent to which these factors (along with traditional enablers) differentiate between different types of non-adoption. The results from a discriminant function analysis (DFA) indicate the coalescence of specific perceptual variables according to the types of non-adoption behavior, specifically, the discriminatory power of differing perceptions of IT between trial rejecters, symbolic rejecters, trial accepters, symbolic adopters, and adopters.

For example, rehabilitation interventions such as hearing aids and communication programs can be presented as options to adults with hearing impairment seeking help for the first time. Our previous research focused on the predictors of intervention decisions when options were presented with a decision aid. However, not all participants took up the intervention they initially decided upon. Although it is interesting to understand what informs adults with hearing impairment's intervention decisions, it is their intervention uptake and outcomes which best represent the ultimate end result of the rehabilitation process. This prospective study investigated the predictors of uptake and of successful outcomes of hearing aids and communication programs in middle-aged and older adults with hearing impairment seeking help for the first time. Design: Using shared decision making, 153 participants with hearing impairment (average of air conduction thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz greater than 25 dB HL in at least one ear) aged 50 yr and older were presented with intervention options: hearing aids, communication programs (group or individual), and no intervention. Each participant received a decision aid and had at least 1 wk to consider intervention options before the intervention decision was made. Outcome measures for both hearing aids and communication programs at 3 mo after intervention completion were benefit (measured with the Client-Oriented Scale of Improvement), composite outcomes (measured with the International Outcome Inventory), and reduction in self-reported hearing disability (measured with the Hearing Handicap Questionnaire). Multivariate analysis (logistic and linear regression) identified predictors of intervention uptake and of successful outcomes when all other variables were held constant. Results: Almost a quarter of the 153 participants (24%) did not take up the intervention they initially decided upon: 6 mo after making their intervention decision, 66 participants (43%) obtained hearing aids, 28 participants (18%) completed communication programs, and 59 participants (39%) did not complete an intervention. Seven intervention uptake predictors were identified: (1) application for subsidized hearing services (participants more likely to obtain hearing aids and less likely to complete no intervention); (2) higher socioeconomic status (no intervention less likely); (3) greater communication self-efficacy (hearing aids less likely); (4) greater contemplation stage of change (no intervention less likely); (5) greater hearing disability perceived by others and self (communication programs less likely); (6) greater perceived communication program effectiveness (communication programs more likely); and (7) greater perceived suitability of individual communication program (hearing aids less likely and communication programs more likely). Six predictors of successful intervention outcomes were identified: (1) higher socioeconomic status; (2) greater initial self-reported hearing disability; (3) lower precontemplation stage of change; (4) greater action stage of change; (5) lower chance locus of control; and (6) greater hearing disability perceived by others and self. Conclusions: Self-reported hearing disability and stages of change are the two most robust predictors of intervention uptake and successful outcomes. Clinicians should offer intervention options and should discuss these predictors when helping adults with hearing impairment make optimal decisions. ¬© 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",33,1,79-93,"acoustic impedance; aged; article; auditory rehabilitation; communication disorder; decision making; female; hearing aid; human; male; methodology; middle aged; patient; patient attitude; patient participation; predictive value; prospective study; psychological aspect; pure tone audiometry; self concept; self report; treatment outcome; Acoustic Impedance Tests; Audiometry, Pure-Tone; Choice Behavior; Communication Barriers; Hearing Aids; Hearing Impaired Persons; Humans; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Rehabilitation of Hearing Impaired; Self Efficacy",

But policy makers need to understand farmers' reasons for adoption of such technologies to design policies that actually work. Using data from a survey with responses from 2439 farmers in five countries around the Baltic Sea, we identify the drivers of technology adoption for three different abatement technologies: manure spreading equipment, slurry tanks, and precision technology for fertiliser application. We compare drivers for technology investments across technologies with a particular focus on the role of the scale of farm operations, neighbour relations, environmental concerns and innovation readiness. The results show that the scale of farm operation is important for the uptake of all three technologies, while we find no evidence that neighbour relations are important for technology investments. Environmental concerns for soil quality and other on-farm environmental qualities do drive investment; however, the impact of environmental concerns differs across technologies. Innovation readiness is a driver of investments in relation to some technologies, suggesting that the novelty or sophistication of the technology matters to the investing farmers. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",159,,91-100,Baltic Sea; Farmer heterogeneity; Nutrient abatement; Technology adoption; agricultural policy; farmers attitude; farmers knowledge; fertilizer application; heterogeneity; innovation; investment incentive; nutrient limitation; operations technology; precision agriculture; soil quality; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Region,

It provides a better understanding of complete energy consumption and carbon emissions profile in Beijing. The results show that for the Beijing residents, when direct and indirect energy consumption and CO2 emissions are taken into account, the total household energy consumption proportion compared to the city increases from 22.7% to 59.2%, and the total household CO2 emissions proportion increases from 32.2% to 68.8% in the research period.

This has encouraged the deployment of renewable energy by many states in their transition into low carbon economies. These efforts have been complemented by an increase in the manufacture of renewable energy technologies within the last decade, which has increased their supply and reduced their cost. Trade has played a significant role in facilitating the transfer of renewable energy technologies. Despite the increase in the manufacture of renewable energy technologies, they remain more costly in comparison with conventional high carbon sources of energy. The high initial capital cost of renewable energy projects is the reason why in most jurisdictions, government intervention is key in their deployment. To obtain domestic and political support for renewable energy projects, many governments promise domestic economic development due to their competing socio-economic priorities and the strategic opportunity that a green economy offers in economic development. Some governments have used national procurement tender programs with local content requirements to promote its domestic industries and job creation. South Africa is one of these countries. The challenge that arises is that this kind of government intervention could conflict with international trade law which advocates for, liberalisation of trade by removal of barriers to trade such as tariffs, quotas and measures that amount to protectionism of domestic markets. Domestic industry prices may not be as competitive as imports from countries with large scale manufacturing capacity and cheaper labour costs and may limit a country's transition into a green economy. This paper attempts to analyse the local content element in the South African renewable energy procurement program, its interaction with international trade law and the policy space available for government intervention.",,210-217,Varazdin Development & Entrepreneurship Agency,,

With growing urban food insecurity, poverty, and unequal access to services, natural resource use may provide a viable alternative to cash-based resources, thus, allowing households to navigate the rural‚Äìurban continuum as they address livelihood needs. This may be especially pertinent for growing, but small, urban landscapes that are in transition. We investigated the use of and access to natural resources in households in rural (Lesoma), peri-urban (Kazungula), and urban (Kasane) settlements in northern Botswana. Semi-structured questionnaires for 85 households were used to investigate household demographics, variety of natural resources used, the availability, use, and importance of natural resources, threats to resources, harvesting locations, and extent of resource commercialization. Significant differences were identified in the mean number of resources used by households across the three settlements (Kruskal‚ÄìWallis Chi-squared = 9.29, df = 2, p = 0.01). Using the post hoc test Conover with Bonferroni adjustment, mean natural resource use between the urban and peri-urban villages did not differ significantly (p = 1). However, both types of villages differed from the rural village in mean resource use (urban p = 0.007 and peri-urban p = 0.012). Nevertheless, urban and peri-urban households reported use of a broad range of natural resources, highlighting the importance of these products in transitioning landscapes. Across the study villages, natural resource harvesting occurred predominantly on communal land. Primary barriers to resource access were perceived to be strict government regulations and decreasing resource availability. Natural resource commercialization was identified as a potential opportunity but was often carried out only on a small scale. The use of natural resources is intuitively thought to be associated with rural areas, but our results suggest that such resources form an important part of livelihoods across urban and peri-urban landscapes as well. This continued reliance on natural resources raises important planning questions about how to ensure both the ongoing conservation of forested and other natural areas, and the availability of associated resources for urban livelihoods. In this regard, small urban towns that are rapidly transitioning from rural landscapes provide a targeted opportunity for early intervention. Our findings underpin the vital role that natural areas play in supporting the livelihoods of the urban poor and highlight the need to encourage land designation and management of such areas not only for conservation but also as a safety net for vulnerable urban households. ¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V.",30,,342-349,,

Solid fuel use in developing countries also impacts on households in other ways, most importantly in time spent collecting fuel, risks of burns, the expense, fuel and time wasted using inefficient stoves, and negative impacts on the environment and income generation. Improving access to cleaner, more efficient energy, therefore, has the potential to deliver substantial health and development gains. This requires interventions that include improved stoves, cleaner fuels, house improvements, and behavior changes, as well as enabling policy to help poor families overcome economic and structural barriers to adoption. Although not currently able to deliver the very low pollution required to minimize adverse health effects, available interventions can substantially reduce exposure and incidence of important diseases. Economic analysis shows that intervention benefits frequently exceed costs. Key ingredients for successful implementation are attention to household needs, quality in design and materials, development of sustainable markets with targeted financial support, and monitoring and evaluation.

This was said to alleviate the burdens of biomass cooking for three billion people by mitigating emissions, reducing deforestation, alleviating expenditure and collection times on fuels and increasing health outcomes. By 2015, international agencies were openly saying it was a failing policy. The dispersal of improved cookstoves was not keeping up with population growth, increasing urbanisation was leading to denser emissions and evidence suggested health effects of improved stoves were not as expected. A call was made for a new strategy, something other than ‚Äòbusiness as usual'. Conventional wisdom suggests that access to electricity is poor in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), that it is too expensive and that weak grids prevent even connected households from cooking. Could a new strategy be built around access to electricity (and gas)? Could bringing modern energy for cooking to the forefront kill two birds with one stone? In 2019, UK Aid announced a multi-million-pound programme on ‚ÄòModern Energy Cooking Services' (MECS), specifically designed to explore alternative approaches to address cooking energy concerns in the Global South.

Four dimensions of future energy forms were identified: next-generation renewables, fossil energy, bioenergy, and established renewable vs. nuclear energy. Four dimensions of the future energy system were also identified: renewing the energy market, domestic power, small-scale producers, and consumer awareness. Five transition drivers were likewise identified: mainstreaming renewable energy, international actors, individual actions, changing values and economy, and emancipatory change. Mainstreaming renewable energy emerged as the key driver of transition, followed by individual actions. Generally, the sustainable energy transition was strongly supported by citizens' images, but different socio-economic groups preferred somewhat different images.

Most of the rural households of North-Eastern India rely heavily upon fuelwood and traditional open-fire cookstoves for cooking activities. And everyday collection of fuelwood is time-consuming. Hence, women often gather fuelwood to make charcoal. While the use of charcoal has some advantages, it is not clear whether the investment of time in making charcoal is worthwhile. In this paper, we compare household time investments for fuelwood and charcoal production. The study is done using survey data on Napaam village situated in Sonitpur District of Assam, Northeast India. We developed a model to analyse fuelwood needed and time spent upon the introduction of improved cookstoves and/or charcoal production. This analysis reveals that improved cookstoves using fuelwood results in the least time expenditure on the production of cooking fuel. Whilst introducing charcoal marginally reduces the amount of fuelwood, but increases time spent on cooking, due to the time required to produce the charcoal. Hence, rural households who make their own charcoal spend more time on producing cooking fuel than those households relying on direct use of fuelwood.",151,,309-316,Fuelwood; Charcoal; Cookstove; Rural area; Time efficiency,

They are manifested through growing demand for modern energy carriers, a fossil fuel dominated energy system facing a severe resource crunch, the need for creating access to quality energy for the large section of deprived population, vulnerable energy security, local and global pollution regimes and the need for sustaining economic development. Renewable energy is considered as one of the most promising alternatives. Recognizing this potential, India has been implementing one of the largest renewable energy programmes in the world. Among the renewable energy technologies. bioenergy has a large diverse portfolio including efficient biomass stoves, biogas, biomass combustion and gasification and process heat and liquid fuels. India has also formulated and implemented a number of innovative policies and programmes to promote bioenergy technologies. However, according to some preliminary studies, the success rate is marginal compared to the potential available. This limited success is a clear indicator of the need for a serious reassessment of the bioenergy programme. Further, a realization of the need for adopting a sustainable energy path to address the above challenges will be the guiding force in this reassessment. In this paper an attempt is made to consider the potential of bioenergy to meet the rural energy needs: (I) biomass combustion and gasification for electricity; (2) biomethanation for cooking energy (gas) and electricity; and (3) efficient wood-burning devices for cooking. The paper focuses on analysing the effectiveness of bioenergy in creating this rural energy access and its sustainability in the long run through assessing: the demand for bioenergy and potential that could be created; technologies, status of commercialization and technology transfer and dissemination in India; economic and environmental performance and impacts: bioenergy policies, regulatory measures and barrier analysis. The whole assessment aims at presenting bioenergy as an integral part of a sustainable energy strategy for India. The results show that bioenergy technology (BET) alternatives compare favourably with the conventional ones. The cost comparisons show that the unit costs of BET alternatives are in the range of 15-187% of the conventional alternatives. The climate change benefits in terms of carbon emission reductions are to the tune of 110 T C per year provided the available potential of BETs are utilized. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

More than 70% of total solar collector capacity worldwide is installed in China. The production of solar collector in China had decreased significantly from 64 million m2 in 2012 to 37 million m2 in 2017, corresponding to a reduction of around 40% of the market in 2012. There are very limited comprehensive studies in existing literature, which have investigated the reasons on the decline of Chinese solar thermal market. This study aims to identify the reasons from both the demand and the supply sides in details. Furthermore, with the rise of emerging markets, such as the rapid development of the ‚ÄúClean Heating Initiative‚Äù for space heating in North China, solar heat industrial process, and the mandatory installation of solar domestic hot water system for residential buildings below 100 m in urban area, the Chinese solar thermal market is expected to recover soon, called ‚ÄúU-shaped curve‚Äù in this study. The market share of flat plate collector and evacuated tube collector is predicted to change in the near future. The research and development of flat plate solar collectors will increase continually in the market other than evacuated tube solar collectors like the past 10 years.

Thus, the review of installed energy technologies for electricity access across African nations as well as the offshore wind resource distribution for energy development based on satellite observations derived from remote sensing systems is presented. It is believed that ideal location for the electricity generation, renewable energy development and markets could be identified by determining the enormous wind resource distribution at the coastal zones. Thus, 6-hourly surface wind dataset recorded for a period of 2001‚Äì2011 across the coasts were proposed for identifying potential turbine sites. Based on the seasonal climate variability, the energy distribution maps of the offshore wind resource at 10 and 160‚ÄØm heights were assessed from East to South, West and North coasts of Africa. In addition, the validity of satellite observations in processing of CCMP L3.0 wind for energy resource assessment across Africa is investigated. Furthermore, the offshore energy potential of two typical turbine (small- and utility-scale) models is evaluated based on the wind resource variation for these periods. For sustainable energy development, results revealed that the coastal zones possess excellent offshore wind energy resource potential for supporting electricity requirements. Annual and seasonal capacity factors of both small and large-scale turbines across the coastal zone were also assessed, ranging between 17.6 and 51.2%. In the achievement of 2020‚Äì2030 energy transition goals from the conventional to clean and diversified energy mix as well as a low carbon society, the studied findings offer useful energy resource information for a sustainable project and increasing penetrations of large-scale wind power on the electric grids across Africa.",161,,1096-1114,Renewable energy; Satellite observations; Wind power; Capacity factor; Site power curve; Africa,

An early transition to renewable energy sources may prove to be beneficial in the long term, i.e., it may result in a steady state at a higher level than in the case of a transition that starts later. Once the economy starts declining it will not be able to afford transition to a more expensive energy system, and transition would only accelerate the decline. Similarly, if a transition is too fast it may weaken and drain economy too much and may result in a lower steady state. If a transition is too slow, global economy may be weakened by the problems related to utilization of fossil fuels (such as global warming and its consequences) before transition is completed and the result again would be a lower steady state.

The data were collected by interviewing 480 respondents by using a pretested and designed questionnaire. The results show that the household adoption rate of biogas technologies is low. The factors affecting the adoption decision of households included household income, access to credit, cultivated land area, the number of cattle in the household, education, and family size. The study also found fundamental barriers to the household adoption of biogas technologies, such as a lack of proper technical services by implementing organizations and insufficient governmental support.

The fuels considered are; fuelwood, kerosene, biogas, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity. Traditional and efficient devices and different discount rates are used in the analysis. Financial analysis for rural areas shows that the efficient Astra-stove using wood is the least cost option and biogas, which is the only quality fuel option for rural areas, is the most expensive option. The subsidised kerosene option is cheaper than wood in the traditional stove. The ranking of options from low to high costs is from fuelwood to kerosene to LPG to biogas. In the urban situation, the subsidy on kerosene distorts the energy ladder. Kerosene is the low cost fuel option, and fuelwood in the traditional stove is among the most expensive options. The existing subsidies on kerosene, LPG and electricity seem to benefit middle and high income groups, particularly in urban areas. Low income households in urban and rural areas are forced to use fuelwood in traditional stoves, which is not only a low quality fuel but is also a high cost cooking energy option. The efficiency of the device is shown to be a crucial factor in determining the cost of using a fuel. Low income households are disadvantaged, as they use traditional low efficiency wood stoves.

Based on province-level panel data for years 1991‚Äì2014 in rural China, it is shown that energy transition from traditional biomass energy (TBE) to traditional commercial energy (TCE) significantly decreases RECPC, while energy transition from TBE or TCE to advanced commercial energy (ACE) significantly increases RECPC. As is revealed by the energy stacking model, per capita income has a significantly negative impact on RECPC, and the impact of lagged RECPC is opposite. Due to the regulation of energy price, there exists price distortion in China's rural energy market and the price mechanism functions poorly. Besides, factors, including juvenile dependency ratio and education level, significantly reduce RECPC. Therefore, it is vital to integrate rural energy into national energy strategic system, facilitate energy transition process and introduce the market system reform of rural energy and continue to improve the education level of rural residents in rural China. ¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V.",74,,523-534,Energy consumption intensity; Residential energy consumption per capita; Rural residential energy transition; Commerce; Costs; Housing; Energy strategic systems; Energy transitions; Per capita; Residential energy; Residential energy consumption; Rural residential energies; Traditional biomass; Energy utilization; energy market; energy use; income; market system; regulatory framework; rural energy; China,

(2007) concerning the relationship between total energy intensity and GDP per capita. In their chiefly descriptive analysis of four European countries (Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain) over the last two centuries, no inverted U-curve relationship was found between total energy intensity (sum of traditional and modern energy sources) and GDP per capita. By contrast, in addition to considering total energy intensity we also distinguish between modern energy intensity and traditional energy intensity. Further, we integrate qualitative analysis with empirical analysis (i.e., the ARDL cointegration procedure) in order to make our results more robust. The main conclusions of Gales et al. (2007) are only partially confirmed: considering total energy intensity can lead to erroneous conclusions. In particular, our estimates show a U-shaped relationship between total energy intensity and GDP per capita. In addition, when we decompose total energy intensity, two different relationships emerge: a hyperbolic pattern (traditional energy carriers) and a U-shaped inverse pattern (modern energy carriers). We conclude that the decreasing branch of the U-shaped relationship between total energy intensity and GDP per capita is driven by traditional energy sources when the latter dominate modern energy sources (low levels of GDP per capita). In contrast, the ascending branch of the U-shaped relationship is driven by modern energy sources when prevailing over traditional sources (high levels of GDP per capita).",,,,Replication; Europe: Pre-1913; Time-series models; Energy sources,

However, adoption of these technologies is lagging behind expectations. Moreover, it is unclear how energy management features in the smart home consumer adoption process. We know there is technical potential for the smart home to support energy management, but we know little about the degree to which energy benefits interest consumers and motivate them to adopt smart home technologies relative to non-energy benefits such as security, comfort, and convenience, which could have implications for increasing rather than decreasing energy consumption. To that point, we know little about whether and how the energy management functionalities of smart home products are actually used by adopters. The present research investigated consumers' knowledge of, attitudes toward, and experiences with smart home technologies that have energy management functionalities (smart HEMS), in order to assess barriers to adoption and to achieving purported energy benefits. Specifically, we studied shoppers at smart home retailers to gauge their existing awareness of and attitudes toward smart HEMS, and we analyzed Amazon customer reviews of smart HEMS to better understand early adopters' motivations and experiences. Results revealed challenges to achieving energy benefits with existing products and marketing strategies, and implications for shaping the future of these technologies to achieve energy demand reductions and load shifting capabilities at scale for the smart home and smart grid of the future. ¬© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",11,7,1897-1911,Connected home; Consumer adoption; Energy management technology; Home energy management; Smart home; Automation; Consumer behavior; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Intelligent buildings; Consumer adoptions; Energy management technologies; Home energy managements; Smart homes; Smart power grids; energy use; household energy; technology adoption,

Traditional approaches to energy reduction look at direct emissions savings, and recommend insulation and efficiency as more cost-effective than microgeneration. However, microgeneration has indirect, 'soft' benefits and could play a significant role in emissions reduction. Current uptake of microgeneration in the UK is low, with various barriers-economic, technical, cultural, behavioural and institutional-both to uptake and to maximising energy and emissions savings once installed. Subsidies and spreading information alone do not guarantee maximising uptake, and even if successful, this is not enough to maximise savings. The industry focuses on maximising sales, with no incentives to ensure best installations and use; householders do not have access to the best information, and user behaviour does not maximise energy and emission savings. This is related to a broader state of socio-technical 'lock-in' in domestic energy use; there's a lack of connection between personal behaviour and energy consumption, let alone global climate change. This suggests that a major cultural-behavioural shift is needed to reduce energy/emissions in the home. Transition theory and strategic niche management provide insights into possible systemic change and a suitable framework for future policies, such as supporting a variety of radically innovative niches, both technological and social. Microgeneration, properly employed, has the potential to play a part in such a transition by increasing awareness and energy literacy and empowering people to seriously engage in energy debates as producers, as well as consumers, of energy. This deeper understanding and heightened responsibility are crucial in a shift toward bottom-up emission-reducing behaviour change and better acceptance of top-down energy-saving policy measures, as part of a new domestic energy paradigm. The implications for policy are that, as well as supporting the technologies, it needs to support existing niches and to develop new niche experiments. Policy needs to consider how to promote empowerment and responsibility and support or even develop new energy sector models; this will involve a range of stakeholders and multiple governance levels, not just national incentive schemes. ¬© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",4,3,335-353,Behaviour; Domestic energy; Microgeneration; Niches; Socio-technical regime; Strategic niche management; Transition; Socio-technical regimes; Behavioral research; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Energy efficiency; energy conservation; energy market; energy use; governance approach; subsidy system; United Kingdom,

We analyze the underlying factors and investment/innovation behavior of individual firms in the German iron and steel industry to better understand barriers and drivers for technological change. The paper gives insights on the decision-making process on energy efficiency in firms and helps to understand how policy affects decision-making. We use a mixed method approach. First, we analyze the diffusion of three energy-efficient technologies (EET) for primary steelmaking from their introduction until today (top-pressure recovery turbine (TRT), basic oxygen furnace gas recovery (BOFGR), and pulverized coal injection (PCI)). We derive the uptake of these technologies both at the national level and at the level of the individual firm. Second, we analyze the impact of drivers and barriers on the decision-making process of individual firms whether or not they want to implement these technologies. Economics and access to capital are the foremost barriers to the uptake of an EET. If the expected payback period exceeds a certain value or if the company lacks capital, investments in EET seem not to happen. But even if an EET is economically viable and the company has access to capital, investments in EET might not be realized. Policy-induced prices might have strengthened the recent diffusion of TRT. We found indications that in a limited number of cases, policy intervention was a driving factor. Technical risks and imperfect information are only marginal factors in our cases. Site-specific factors seem to be important, as site-specific factors shape the economics of the selected EET. ¬© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",10,2,441-457,Barriers; Diffusion; Drivers; Energy efficiency; Iron and steel industry; Basic oxygen converters; Coal; Decision making; Diffusion barriers; Economics; Investments; Iron; Metal recovery; Steelmaking; Truck drivers; Decision making process; Energy efficient technology; Energy intensive industries; German steel industry; Imperfect information; Pulverized coal injection; Technological change; industrial policy; industrial technology; innovation; investment; technology diffusion; Germany,

In addition, the functional status and sustainability of the constructed biogas plants remain unknown. The objective of this study, therefore, was to investigate and assess the factors that affect the adoption and sustainability of the technology by dairy cattle farmers. The study employed the ex-post-facto social survey research design. The target population was the 9466 farmers in Nakuru and Nakuru North districts. Selection of the two hundred farmers was through stratified proportionate random sampling procedure in order to represent the various plant designs and farmer populations in the respective administrative divisions. Data collection was through a pre-tested interview schedule, two types of questionnaires and a personal observation schedule while analysis was through descriptive and inferential statistics (Chi-square) by use of SPSS software. The results of the analysis revealed that while a farmer's socio-economic status significantly influenced the decision to adopt the technology, it did not influence the sustainability of the constructed plants. The research concluded that while the potential of the technology to flourish in the study area is high, its promotion is necessary. However due to the multifaceted nature of the problem, remedial action calls for a multi-disciplinary approach by all stakeholders that include governmental and non-governmental organizations, technology experts, farmers as well as research and training institutions. The promotion exercise should take into consideration the adoption constraints that include awareness creation, land tenure security, financial capital, livestock improvement and research and policy review.",13,,106-115,,

Within unequal societies, such as South Africa, a reliance on technical solutions to address access and inequality is inadequate, leading to resistance and protest. Further, introduction of a technical solution ‚Äì such as solar PV - to address energy access in urban informal settlements, is a complex process, and requires a systems thinking perspective. Using Community Based System Dynamics modelling, this paper therefore investigated the issues that affect energy fuel choice and energy access as related to the introduction of a renewable energy solution in Enkanini informal settlement. Different energy user groups were engaged in the identification of the factors that affect energy access and energy fuel choice; the relationships between these factors in order to improve future interventions; and development of causal loop diagrams to visualise the key feedback loops. The identified factors were economic and market related such as affordability, availability, and land ownership but also included a range of socio-political aspects. 17 feedback loops emerged, of which 13 were reinforcing loops, and 4 were balancing loops. The key feedback loops relate to community empowerment and representation, whilst participation in the political process and the quest for legitimacy through direct electricity connections were recognised as broader issues to be addressed.",49,,39-52,Informal settlement; Slum; Energy access; Electrification; Community based system dynamics; Solar photovoltaic,

Good health and well-being; 5. Gender equality; 7. Affordable and clean energy; 13. Climate action; 15. Life on land. Programs are being implemented around the world to introduce alternative cooking technologies, and we are well on the way to achieving the goal set by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves to reach 100 million homes with cleaner and more efficient cooking methods by 2020. Despite evidence that household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuel combustion is responsible for 3‚Äì4 million early deaths per year, many cookstove programs are motivated and/or financed by climate change mitigation schemes and deploy alternative stoves that use solid fuels such as wood and charcoal. However, recent studies have demonstrated that improved biomass-burning stoves typically only incrementally improve air quality and yield modest or minimal health benefits. Likewise, their contributions to climate change mitigation and other SDGs may be limited. Evidence indicates that cleaner fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ethanol and biogas, offer greater potential benefits not only to health, but also greater progress towards climate goals and other relevant SDGs. We present a modeled estimate of these potential gains for a diverse group of 40 LMICs. Our model suggests that cookstove programs using LPG stoves and fuel will yield greater reductions in both Disability Adjusted Life Years and Global Warming Commitment in these countries than those using improved biomass stoves. Cost and infrastructure requirements for clean fuels such as LPG are widely recognized constraints. In view of these constraints we present an analytical method to simultaneously consider health and climate needs at the national level for the same 40 countries in the context of estimated LPG expansion potentials. Comparative analyses integrating priorities across SDGs at the national and regional levels may guide more practical and effective household energy development choices going forward.",42,,152-159,,

While conventional grid extension has been the predominant mode of electrification in the region, the countries have also extensively used solar photovoltaic (PV) technology for energy access. However, there have been implementation challenges including technical, financial, institutional, and governance barriers. This paper, based on extensive literature review and survey of selected programs, shares the experience and lessons of solar PV programs for rural electrification in South Asia - both at the regional and country levels - and also presents a comparative analysis to exploit the cross learning potential. The paper suggests that output focused approaches, financial innovations, bundling of projects for concentrating energy loads, adopting, standard processes and metrics, developing necessary infrastructure, and building local technical capacity are a key to enhancing the effectiveness of the solar PV programs.

This objective was achieved by illustrating the linkage between fuel choice and energy poverty in low income households in an urban context. It employs a cross-sectional energy stacking model to illustrate fuel choice and the multidimensional energy poverty (MEP) index to establish the severity of energy poverty in low income households in Kisumu City, Kenya. The study also incorporates pico-solar products (PSPs) users, as this disruptive technology entered the Kenyan solar market in recent years, targeting low income households using kerosene for lighting purposes. The study identifies energy appliance type and household cooking location as key determinants of household energy choice. Moreover, the main determinants for household energy choice in households facing higher levels of energy poverty were closely associated with access concerns, whereas determinants in households facing lower levels of energy poverty were more associated with usage concerns as they already had access to modern energy. It was also noted that preferences were related to attributes of the energy source both experienced by current users and perceived by current non-users. There was a substantial persistent use of kerosene as an alternative lighting source among current PSPs users. There is a general preference and desire to use modern energy sources across most households, irrespective of the severity of energy poverty. For meaningful improvement to be realized towards meeting the energy SDG by 2030, national and local energy policies should consider the energy technology adoption perception and behaviours of populations currently not having modern energy access. In conclusion, it is of great importance to put into context the specific characteristics of the households as well as user perspectives and how these characteristics and perspectives would affect continuity of usage of the modern energy source adopted.",42,,43478,Multidimensional energy poverty (MEP); Pico-solar products (PSPs); Solar home systems (SHS); Kenya,

Developing countries, where centralized electricity infrastructures are less developed, may be able to adopt these new technologies more quickly. We first review the costs of grid extension and distributed solar home systems (SHSs) as reported by a number of different studies. We then present a general analytic framework for analyzing the choice between extending the grid and implementing distributed solar home systems. Drawing upon reported grid expansion cost data for three specific regions, we demonstrate this framework by determining the electricity consumption levels at which the costs of provision through centralized and decentralized approaches are equivalent in these regions. We then calculate SHS capital costs that are necessary for these technologies provide each of five tiers of energy access, as defined by the United Nations Sustainable Energy for All initiative. Our results suggest that solar home systems can play an important role in achieving universal access to basic energy services. The extent of this role depends on three primary factors: SHS costs, grid expansion costs, and centralized generation costs. Given current technology costs, centralized systems will still be required to enable higher levels of consumption; however, cost reduction trends have the potential to disrupt this paradigm. By looking ahead rather than replicating older infrastructure styles, developing countries can leapfrog to a more distributed electricity service model.",31,,97-107,Solar home system; Grid extension; Global energy access; Decentralized electrification; International energy development,

An analytical framework of four questions was used to synthesise the findings. What energy transitions are taking place in small rural enterprises, who benefits? Does the presence of modern energy carriers/technology stimulate production? Does an increase in productivity lead to a decrease in poverty in terms of financial capital? What is the impact of the changes in energy carrier/technology on the other four types of capital in the livelihood framework? For all of the above, the dominant contextual factors influencing the process were noted. Electricity was the modern energy carrier surveyed in the three countries.

Emphasis is given to the first generation biofuels, biodiesel and bioethanol, as the second-generation biofuels using whole biomass are still at an early stage of development and would require long and strong public support to be available on an industrial scale. A big consideration is biomass supply, as these resources may affect land availability and competition with food and feed production. These aspects are addressed in a separate paper. Small-scale stand-alone power generation is briefly discussed, as is the possible use of straight vegetable oil (SVO). The main barrier to the development ofbiofuel is economic.

There is presently very little information on potential barriers to the successful development of densified biomass for household cooking and heating in China, but such knowledge may be informative in settings that aim to replace unprocessed coal and other polluting fuels with renewable, cleaner-burning energy sources. We designed a case study to coordinate data-gathering efforts at rural field sites in southwestern Sichuan province and northeastern Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, where production of densified biomass fuels is under development for household end-users. We conducted interviews with factory personnel, local administrative leaders, and sector experts involved in the production and distribution of densified fuel, including pellets and briquettes, for household use. Results from our qualitative textual data analysis yielded several recommendations for improving development of densified biomass fuels for household end-use. These included reducing heterogeneity of feedstocks, increasing financial support for operational costs (e.g. collection, transport, and storage of raw materials; storage and distribution of final products), improving household perceptions of and subsequent demand for densified biomass fuels, and increasing enforcement of national and provincial policies banning the use of coal and open-field biomass burning. Collection and storage of raw materials and the final densified fuel product were consistently noted as critical challenges to scaling up production at all three sites. Finally, the perspectives of factory managers and local village administrators that we present also indicated that production of densified biomass fuels would most likely be more successful and reproducible in places where national-level policies are viewed as obligatory.

The study is based on primary data collection among poor inhabitants of Villa Fiorito and Budge, in southern Greater Buenos Aires. These data are complemented by qualitative information. We found a notable absence of appropriate and comprehensive policies both for providing access to clean energy and for securing its affordability. Specifically and going beyond energy aspects, the roots of poverty are related to two unaddressed structural issues: land tenure and the availability of regular employment. Although modern energy sources (LPG and electricity) are broadly used by poor households in Greater Buenos Aires, LPG availability and affordability is found to be a key issue. Compounding fuel availability, another barrier to access can be the high upfront cost of LPG cylinders. Often it is replaced by charcoal and kerosene by poor slum families, and these fuels are dirtier and less efficient, thus increasing energy consumption and possibly even fuel expenditure for cooking. The study attempts to quantify unmet basic energy needs, finding that cooling, lighting, and space-heating have the smallest satisfaction levels. The study found that 54 % of the total surveyed energy expenditure is on cooking fuels. The study revealed some desirable actions and possible substitution between fuels. LPG should replace charcoal for cooking as much as possible, since the former is a cleaner fuel and substantially more energy-efficient. In the longer run, natural gas network connection and a safe and affordable electricity service should be available. Facilitating access to LPG and natural gas through subsidized tariffs and efficient equipment would also trigger a positive impact on the environment, on the quality of life of poor people, and their perception of social inclusion.",12,4,56-72,"energy and poverty; basic energy needs; useful energy analysis; household energy consumption patterns, sources and uses",

The data makes evident that a transition has taken place in recent years, both unnoticed by and without external support from governmental or non-governmental organizations: the rural population without electricity in Africa has replaced kerosene lights and candles by simple, yet more efficient and cleaner LED lamps powered by non-rechargeable batteries. Nevertheless, we also show that the discharged batteries are generally disposed of inappropriately in latrines or the nature. The toxic content of many dry-cell batteries and their accumulation at local litter hotspots may have harmful repercussions on health and the environment.

Hence identifying and analysing the underlying barriers for the deployment of large-scale renewables are essential. This study investigates the barriers to large-scale solar power in Tanzania. Key institutional, financial, and technological barriers are identified at different levels. The study uses a qualitative methodology where primary data is collected through 30 semi-structured interviews with experts representing the main electricity sector's stakeholders from public institutions, research institutions, private investors, civil society organizations, development partners, and financial institutions. A stakeholder-based approach which emphasizes the different perceptions of the stakeholder's groups is used to identify the barriers. Institutional barriers for the diffusion of large-scale solar power technologies are found to be predominant, and they often trigger financial and technological barriers. The study consolidates the view that foreign investment and aid directed to expand electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa need to be reshaped in order to be a driving force towards sustainable energy transition in the region. The study argues for the possibility to work on the compatible interests between the pro-renewables development partners and the Tanzanian government (which considers expanding electrification as a political priority) through introducing large-scale solar power projects that help in expanding electrification while being technically and financially supported by the development partners. ¬© 2018",48,,43-58,Barrier analysis; Qualitative research; Renewable energy; Stakeholder-based approach; Sub-Saharan Africa; Tanzania; Economic and social effects; Electric utilities; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Investments; Privatization; Renewable energies; Solar energy; alternative energy; civil society; energy planning; power generation; qualitative analysis; research work; solar power; stakeholder,

The initiative has set itself the lofty aim of providing energy service comparable to clean sources such as LPG but using the same solid biomass fuels commonly used today. Such a clean energy option for the estimated 160 million Indian households now cooking with inefficient and polluting biomass and coal cookstoves could yield enormous gains in health and welfare for the weakest and most vulnerable sections of society. At the same time, cleaner household cooking energy through substitution by advanced-combustion biomass stoves (or other options such as clean fuels) can nearly eliminate the several important products of incomplete combustion that come from today's practices and are important outdoor and greenhouse pollutants. Using national surveys, published literature and assessments, and measurements of cookstove performance solely from India, we find that about 570,000 premature deaths in poor women and children and over 4% of India's estimated greenhouse emissions could be avoided if such an initiative were in place today. These avoided emissions currently would be worth more than US$1 billion on the international carbon market. In addition, about one-third of India's black carbon emissions can be reduced along with a range of other health- and climate-active pollutants that affect regional air quality and climate. Although current advanced biomass stoves show substantial emissions reductions over traditional stoves, there is still additional improvement needed to reach LPG-like emission levels. We recognize that the technology development and deployment challenges to meet NCI goals of this scale are formidable and a forthcoming companion paper focuses on what program design elements might best be able to overcome these challenges.",14,2,63-72,,

Based on an analysis of a rural household survey data in Hubei province in 2004, we explore patterns of residential fuel use within the conceptual framework of fuel switching using statistical approaches. Cross-sectional data show that the transition from biomass to modern commercial sources is still at an early stage, incomes may have to rise substantially in order for absolute biomass use to fall, and residential fuel use varies tremendously across geographic regions due to disparities in availability of different energy sources. Regression analysis using logit and tobit models suggest that income, fuel prices, demographic characteristics, and topography have significant effects on fuel switching. Moreover, while switching is occurring, the commercial energy source which appears to be the principal substitute for biomass in rural households is coal. Given that burning coal in the household is a major contributor to general air pollution in China and to negative health outcomes due to indoor air pollution, further transition to modern and clean fuels such as biogas, LPG, natural gas and electricity is important. Further income growth induced by New Countryside Construction and improvement of modern and clean energy accessibility will play a critical role in the switching process.",14,,,,

The discussion looks at biogas technology as adapted and utilized in Sri Lanka. It is shown that the technology has received attention from the initial days of the energy crisis in 1973, including a ‚ÄúColombo Declaration‚Äù calling for regional development of biogas technology. However, there has been limited popularization and application of biogas in the country. Biogas systems have been promoted for their capability to provide lighting and as a cooking gas, both energy needs, and then as a way to produce bio-fertilizer from solid waste streams for agricultural needs. Biogas systems, used and in use, are identified and reasons for failures are summarized. The ways in which the process has been promoted are also considered and it is seen that the container approach has been given more weightage than the process itself. The process taking place during biogasification has been largely ignored and taken for granted in the dissemination of the technology. Also shown is the fact that promises made in trying to get the technology accepted are impossible to fulfil when a simple analysis is performed. This is shown with respect to cattle-owning families of Sri Lanka. The paper concludes with the recent developments in attempts to introduce biogas systems in the country. From a developing country perspective the paper argues that the ways in which this technology has been promoted are unacceptable.

While monthly household spending on energy has increased in many Indian states, this change is not driven by increased household affluence. Statistical analysis shows that when modern fuels (LPG for cooking, electricity for lighting and appliances) are available, households are willing and able to spend on energy. Indian households that have seen improved access to LPG and electricity have also seen much higher energy expenditures, whereas increased household incomes do not explain greater spending on household energy. For policymakers, the key lesson is that programs to improve access to modern fuels allow both wealthy and poor households to spend money on valuable energy services.",35,,23-34,Energy access; Energy poverty; Sustainable development; India; Survey analysis,

Drawing on an original survey of 8568 households across six Indian states, we uncover the predictors of such satisfaction. Households do not find firewood collection inconvenient, but they are dissatisfied if they have to travel long distance to purchase firewood. Among sub-components of subjective satisfaction, reduction in smoke, speed of cooking, and quality of meals dominate over others (difficulty, cost, and safety). Moreover, we identify access to LPG – a modern cooking fuel – as a strong and robust predictor of high subjective satisfaction, mostly through reduction in smoke and increase in speed of cooking. Rural households ascribe a lot of value to access modern cooking fuels that reduce indoor air pollution, and beneficiaries of interventions to improve such access would value it. Thus, efforts to reduce reliance on cooking with traditional biomass are not just paternalistic top-down interventions but contribute to significantly improve households' satisfaction with their cooking arrangements.",38,,34-47,Energy poverty; Energy access; Cooking fuels; Survey research; India,

The objectives were to delineate and evaluate the methods used to promote improved stoves, to assess the development of commercial stove production and marketing organizations, and to measure the household impacts of the programs through surveys of health, stoves, and indoor air quality. The team found that China implemented broadly successful programs that delivered better stoves to a majority of households in targeted counties. That success was based on strong administrative, technical, and outreach competence and resources situated at the local level, motivated by sustained national-level attention. Despite overstated claims for penetration of improved stoves, mostbiomass stoves now in use have flues and other ‚Äúimproved‚Äù aspects, although field efficiencies are less than design efficiencies. However, most coal stoves, even those using improved fuel (briquettes), lack flues and cannot be considered improved. While in most areas ‚Äúimproved‚Äù stove technology became ‚Äúconventional‚Äù, some areas remain significant exceptions and require intervention. Large roles for government oversight of quality control and support of R&D remain inadequately fulfilled. Most results of indoor air quality monitoring and health surveys were not clear-cut, in part because of the wide variety of fuel and stove combinations used by households. For nearly all household stove/fuel groupings, however, PM4 levels were higher than ‚Äì and sometimes more than twice as high as ‚Äì the national standard for indoor air (150 Œºg PM10/m3). If these results are typical, then a large fraction of China's rural population is now chronically exposed to levels of pollution far higher than those determined by the Chinese government to harm human health. Improved stoves in the surveyed households did result in reduced PM4 concentrations indoors for biomass fuel combinations. Coal use was associated with elevated levels of CO in exhaled breath, and improved biomass stoves with lower levels. Childhood asthma and adult respiratory disease were positively associated with coal use and negatively associated with improved stoves and good stove maintenance. The benefits of using improved biomass stoves can be outweighed by the use of portable coal stoves without flues.

RE capacity exhibits a U-shaped relationship with per capita income, similar to other metrics for environmental quality (EQ). To explain this phenomenon, I consider several of the environmental Kuznets curve theories that describe the relationship between income and environmental quality (Y-EQ), including evolving property rights, increased demand for improved EQ, and changing economic composition. The results fail to provide support for the Y-EQ theories. I further consider the alternative hypothesis that increases in unemployment lead to increases in relative RE capacity, suggesting that promoting RE projects as a potential job creator is one of the main drivers of RE projects. The results imply that lagged unemployment is a significant predictor of relative RE capacity, particularly for states with a large manufacturing share of GDP. Copyright ¬© 2015 by the IAEE.

Several measures to avoid the carbon lock-in involve technology-specific measures, which in turn implies that those measures may result in an energy system locked-in to certain low carbon technologies. We consider that the Brazilian system needs policies to escape the carbon lock in, which are based on providing incentives to low carbon technologies. We develop an analytical framework to analyze the role of regulatory institutions in the possible lock-in to utility-scale photovoltaic, in the sense that they create barriers to the adoption of distributed-generation photovoltaic. We show that the definition of a process to adapt the institutional framework in a context of stress in the innovation system is crucial for the adoption of new technologies. Applying our framework to the Brazilian power sector, we observe that only when regulators consider the possibility that the system is locked-in to centralized production technologies (and not when they just consider the carbon lock-in) they manage to eliminate barriers to distributed generation based on solar PV. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",114,,465-481,Energy transitions; Evaluative criteria; Institutional evolution; Path-dependence; Distributed power generation; Societies and institutions; Institutional framework; Low-carbon technologies; Path dependence; Path-dependent process; Production technology; Locks (fasteners); advanced technology; energy policy; innovation; photovoltaic system; regulatory framework; solar power; technology adoption; Brazil,

The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has identified the potential amongst the farming industry to help meet this objective (DEFRA, 2007) but there is little published research on how organisations can successfully interact with farmers to achieve structural change. This paper reports the findings of a postal questionnaire survey of farmers in the West Midlands Region of the UK where principal component analysis revealed that personal, farm business, regulatory and behavioural drivers affected the rate of adoption of renewable energy (RE) enterprises. Of the 393 farmers who responded, 14% had adopted one or more enterprises associated with RE with solar energy production the most popular of the RE technologies available to farmers. The study found that the most influential personal level factors contributing to the adoption of RE and associated technologies were cognitive, such as level of education, but not administrative, such as the attractiveness of government schemes supporting RE and associated enterprises. Adopters also tended to be younger than non-adopters, perhaps reflecting the impact of long investment payback periods typically found with RE enterprises, they were involved with larger and more financially viable businesses that were more likely to trade as limited companies or family partnerships. Of current non adopters, 66% might decide to invest in RE technologies over the next five years. For these potential adopters, it emerged that personal, farm business and behavioural factors were the most significant drivers though contrary to expectation current non adopters assessed the policy support framework more favourably than current adopters. The explanation of this seems to be connected with timing, in that two very positive and encouraging signals in relation to Feed in Tariffs (2010) and the Renewable Heat Incentive (2011) were underway or near introduction before this research took place.

Both India and Indonesia have ambitious targets for adoption of these technologies, and India has an impressive current rate of uptake. Substantial obstacles exist, however, including the entrenched positions of coal and other fossil fuels, regulatory barriers to market access, and weak abilities of electricity utilities to manage intermittent renewables. This paper reviews these obstacles and discusses strategies to overcome them. We focus on the use of reverse auction processes able to deliver low-price solar and wind contracts, as are being successfully employed in India, on tax and subsidy reform options, on regulatory and incentive-design strategies, on approaches to bolster grid management capacities, and on the importance of minimizing protectionist barriers.

These changes in government policy and in the resultant trajectory of the solar PV sector are attributed to three main sets of variables. The most important of these are events which shape the wider policy priorities of China's government. Secondary factors include the government's poor management of the policy interaction between the domestic solar PV manufacturing industry and the deployment of solar PV across the country, as well as policy learning within government.

Promoting energy transition is among the great challenges for China. As one of the most developed megacities in China, Beijing promotes energy transition intensively. In this study, we explored the trends, socioeconomic drivers and environmental impacts of the energy transition process in Beijing during the decades. We found that Beijing's energy transition has gone through four typical stages. After a parallel growth between the economy and coal-dominated energy consumption at beginning, the growth rate of energy consumption has gradually slowed down since 1996. Between 2000 and 2007, the energy structure became relatively balanced and diversified, driven by the changes of energy intensity, energy structure, and final demand composition, along with the economic structure's shift from heavy manufacturing to service. Thereafter, economic development was seriously decoupled from direct energy consumption, and the de-coal trend had made remarkable achievements. SO2 and NOx emissions have declined significantly since 2007. Diversified energy structure based on the de-coal trend, cleaner energy, and economic restructuring promotes energy transition. Meanwhile the feasibility of implementation also should be considered in other cities' energy transition process in China. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",117,,173-183,Air pollution; China; De-coal; Energy transition,

From a practical viewpoint, community approaches are deemed essential in order to transition from a predominantly centralized energy supply to a decentralized one, and to exploit the potential of renewable energies. In this paper, I discuss how the emergence of community-based energy projects can be analyzed from an institutional perspective. In this context, a 'community' is treated as an individual institutional order that shapes decisions. I examine how community structures the implementation of biogas cooperatives in the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol in Northern Italy. My findings suggest that 'community spirit', a cooperative tradition, and the norms of locality and responsibility are central drivers behind the emergence and constitution of biogas cooperatives. Not only do these institutional features of community influence the decision concerning which farmers are in or out but also plant location and scale.

This paper examines the various barriers to adoption of RE and the way cooperatives are circumventing those obstacles in order to develop the use of RE. This study surveyed a sample of 9 cooperatives from countries where governments are subsidizing the use of RE. The paper identifies a set of specific barriers to the adoption of RE by consumers. It also reveals that cooperatives effectively contribute to the uptake of RE with community-based social marketing initiatives that are lowering those barriers successfully. Those initiatives are related to educational communication, low prices, local offers with complementary services, and cooperative distribution.

The study found that focusing efforts solely on the electricity sector is likely to achieve modest changes to the primary energy mix, but no reduction in total GHG emissions by 2030.

In this paper, we present an exploratory analysis of the effects of subsidy policies for LPG in reducing USF in LAC countries when controlling for indicators of socioeconomic development and urbanization. In LAC, subsidies to LPG have substantially contributed to accelerate the transition from USF to clean fuels for cooking. Targeted subsidies should be considered as a policy option to implement the SDG7 on clean energy.

Based on the interviews and a review of other observable implications of the various drivers, four chiefly political drivers clearly stood out: domestic politics, global pressure and partnerships, attracting investment, and energy sovereignty.

This argument would however not hold when applied to the more technologically advanced South Africa where a whopping 50% of rural households still suffer a similar fate. The common perception is that in the presence of modern technology the desired social change process will automatically commence. Unfortunately (and possibly due to pressure from donors) typical post project reports from the third world often contain deliberate commissions or omissions that essentially belie the grim reality on the ground.

The country is also an important global supplier of coal, petroleum and natural gas while per capita fossil energy consumption is relatively low. For biomass- and fossil fuel-based energy, Indonesia has been transforming its energy landscape in order to provide for foreign demand. The landscape - both in literal and in the figurative sense - simultaneously forms and is formed by the material resource flows required for society's biophysical reproduction, i.e. the social metabolism; in the context of the ongoing energy transition, both are subject to change. In our analysis of Indonesia's palm oil production, we find that the drivers shaping the country's resource use as well as its energy landscape are located at a spatial, temporal, and functional distance from where they take effect. The energy landscape and resource use patterns are formed across levels of scale, from the subnational to the global. Energy policy confined to the framework of the sovereign nation-state cannot effectively address the complex drivers of increasingly detrimental environmental change associated with energy transitions nor can it trigger a sustainability transition. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",109,,817-824,(re)territorialization; Distal drivers; Energy transition; Palm oil; Social metabolism; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Metabolism; Natural resources management; Oil shale; Physiology; Sustainable development; Energy transitions; Environmental change; Fossil energy consumption; Human consumption; Material resources; Social metabolisms; Sustainability transition; ecological economics; energy use; oil production; resource development; territoriality; vegetable oil; Indonesia,

State-level regression models based on data from 61st (2004‚Äì05), 68th (2011‚Äì12) and 71st (2014) rounds of National Sample Survey are used. While energy expenditures are found to be comparable for kerosene and electricity for lighting, it increases 3.6‚Äì8.8-fold for transition to LPG from traditional fuel. Availability is important for greater uptake of electricity i.e. higher rate of electrification helps, but the same is not true for LPG. While untargeted tariff-subsidy leads to significant budgetary pressure, it doesn't affect the access. States with higher income and literacy rate/women empowerment have greater access to LPG and electricity. This shows while Indian energy policies always focused on removal of supply-side barriers through infrastructure creation, removal of first cost barrier and subsidizing tariff, a more meaningful way to ensure access is perhaps to integrate energy policies within the broader arena of comprehensive development policies to ensure improvement in socio-economic indicators. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",131,,131-143,Energy access; Energy availability; Energy subsidy; India; Women empowerment; Budget control; Cost benefit analysis; Economics; Energy policy; Fuels; Gas fuel analysis; Lighting; Regression analysis; Energy subsidies; Liquefied petroleum gas; electricity generation; empowerment; energy market; energy resource; energy use; household energy; socioeconomic indicator; sustainable development; womens status,

A range of such initiatives were evidence of an emerging movement for bottom-up change in energy systems. This involved a variety of actors, technologies, economic models and modes of engagement with the public. Indeed, research undertaken in the UK found over 50 possible pathways for change based on such urban energy projects. However, the following decade has seen considerable changes in the context for such initiatives, particularly with regard to national policy frameworks. Returning to a database collected in 2010-11, this paper analyses the nature of the projects that have survived and those that have not. It finds that the hope of localised urban action for changing energy systems rests largely with community-based projects, but that these are fragile, with limited capacity and dependent on having a sound financial model for their survival. The paper concludes with suggestions for how such localised urban action could be reinvigorated but also assesses the current role of such local action.",129,,653-660,Urban energy systems; Community energy; Experiments; Financial models; COMMUNITY RENEWABLE ENERGY; TRANSITIONS; GOVERNANCE; POLITICS; PARTICIPATION; PATHWAYS; DRIVERS; SYSTEMS; CITIES; CHINA,

The key areas of concern include emphasis on supply-driven grid electricity; vested power dynamics favouring affluent and urban areas; unreliability of energy service provision; and misdirected and misappropriated subsidies. The above-mentioned issues are responsible for limiting accelerated achievement of universal energy access in the ‚ÄúBig 5‚Äù countries and need to be addressed through innovative approaches. The paper emphasizes the need for firm commitments, policy convergence, and the implementation of 'pro-poor' equitable energy policies through a broad-based energy framework of bench-marked, technology-neutral energy provisioning that ensures reliability and equity.

However, combined cycle natural gas technology would have a significant financial advantage over both coal and renewables under current technology options and market conditions. On the basis of cost projections made under the assumption of mature technologies and the existence of economies of scale, renewable technologies would possess a significant social cost advantage if the externalities of power production were to be ""internalised"".

In doing so, they will contribute greatly to a shift in household and community energy use from reliance on traditional fuels to more modern energy services. However, such a shift is a complex and uncertain process, with mini-grids often struggling to achieve sustainability after initial project funding ends. This paper draws on service design approaches to understand challenges associated with adoption of electricity services from the user perspective. By developing a user journey map, our study explores users' experience associated with connecting to and using electricity services from a 60 kW solar mini-grid in Mpanta, a small rural fishing community in northern Zambia. Our study finds that poor expectation management and limited integration of local socioeconomic dynamics in mini-grid service design, including their impact on affordability, has led to a slow and partial shift in household energy use. Better incorporation of the user perspective in the design, implementation and evaluation of mini-grids can help to identify potential barriers to adoption of electricity services and adapt it to the local context. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",121,,25-34,Rural electrification; Service design; Solar mini-grids; User journey mapping; Zambia; Rural areas; Electricity service; Household energy use; Mini grids; Potential barriers; Renewable energies; Electric power transmission networks; electrification; energy efficiency; household energy; rural area; smart grid; solar power,

Fourteen years later, and with household electrification at over 80%, millions still use solid fuels and yet ambitious policy objectives to address this situation are not being met. Using three theoretical frameworks; institutional capacity, policy inheritance and the symbolic use of policy, this paper analyses the reasons why household energy policy objectives related to solid fuels and health, as stated in the 1998 South African energy policy, have not been implemented. The results of the analysis show that the symbolic use of policy, including meanings of objects used for meeting policy objectives is the most critical explanation. The paper illustrates that political and historical contexts are critical to understanding policy outcomes in developing and transition countries which often experience tensions between implementing what may seem as objective policies, and that matches their political and historical experiences and aspirations.

Both issues can potentially be addressed by aggregating projects into diversified portfolios - an approach commonly used by investors in several contexts, but little investigated in the context of rural electrification.

The global responses to address the above concerns in terms of renewable energy technologies, policies and strategies that can be instrumental in addressing the issues are discussed, with main emphasis on the CDM under the Kyoto Protocol. The critical issue of whether the CDM can address poverty alleviation and sustainable development in developing countries is discussed in the context of existing market principles, transparency of the mechanism, economics and the daunting bureaucratic procedures involved. The paper concludes that the CDM, if suitably modified, can go some way to address sustainable development and alleviate poverty for poor rural areas and not increase emissions by a focus on renewable energy technologies.

The realization of the urgency of providing modern energy technology and services particularly to rural areas has prompted both the Nepalese government and development institutions to focus on community-run renewable energy facilities. It is argued that off-grid and micro-scale energy development offers an alternative path to fossil-fuel use and top-down resource management as they democratize the grid and increase marginalized communities' access to renewable energy, education and health care. However, Nepal's energy development is also heavily influenced by demands from the fast-growing economies of neighboring countries such as China and India. As a result, this article evaluates the Nepalese national energy policies by applying the key aspects of the energy justice framework and showing the feasibility constraints due to geopolitical and biophysical factors to the implementation of energy just policies in this developing country context.

An increase in fuelwood shadow price was associated with reduced household fuelwood consumption with price elasticity of ‚àí0.38.

An international technology transfer mechanism has been proposed under the UNFCCC; however, it remains unclear how this international mechanism would translate into local level technology implementation. This study uses biogas technology in South Africa to obtain empirical data inductively related to technology transfer. Observations and activities specific to the biogas sector in South Africa are put forward based on site visits and stakeholder discussions in South Africa, the UK, Germany and Sweden. This paper presents empirical findings on technology transfer in the biogas sector in South Africa and analyses the role of an international technology mechanism in supporting the uptake of biogas. Many of the barriers to biogas technology in South Africa are national level constraints such as lack of supportive policy environment, financial incentives and information sharing. This case study supports the argument that it will be unrealistic for international technology mechanisms to capture the necessary specificities of individual technologies at a country level. Therefore, as demonstrated through the example of biogas technology in South Africa, there is a need for both effective national and international engagement to support technology implementation. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",51,,301-311,Biogas in South Africa; Technology transfer; UNFCCC; Empirical data; Empirical findings; Financial incentives; Germany; Global emissions; Individual technology; Information sharing; International technology; International technology transfers; Low-carbon technologies; National level; Site visits; South Africa; Support technology; Technology implementation; Developing countries; Biogas; empirical analysis; incentive; negotiation process; stakeholder; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Sweden; United Kingdom,

This paper uses a demand-based approach to define the energy poverty line as the threshold point at which energy consumption begins to rise with increases in household income. At or below this threshold point, households consume a bare minimum level of energy and should be considered energy poor. This approach was applied using cross-sectional data from a comprehensive 2004 household survey representative of rural Bangladesh. The findings suggest that some 58 percent of rural households in Bangladesh are energy poor, versus 45 percent that are income poor.

The framework entails establishment of rural energy access authorities and energy access funds, both at the national and regional levels, to be empowered with enabling regulatory policies, capital resources and the support of multi-stakeholder partnership. These institutions are expected to design, lead, manage and monitor the rural energy interventions. At the other end, trained entrepreneurs would be expected to establish bioenergy-based micro-enterprises that will produce and distribute energy carriers to rural households at an affordable cost.

In the absence of meaningful government engagement, technological choices and business models are influenced by the interests and norms of external actors, including a stronger emphasis on health outcomes than other livelihood or environmental benefits.

Based on the predictions of ""energy transition"" theory, a regional shift from biomass to ""modern"" fuels has long been expected to occur in tandem with urban growth. However, trends observed in the region's towns and cities have often not followed such patterns and fuelwood continues to be important in most areas. This paper examines the practical relevance of transition theory using a recent case study, conducted by the authors in Maun, Botswana, and results previously reported in the literature. It finds that, despite the long-term link between socio-economic development and increased modern fuel consumption at the national scale, the notion of ""transition"" does not accurately reflect ongoing energy-use patterns at lower levels of aggregation. This is chiefly because its model of household fuel switching largely dismisses the importance of active (and strategic) decision making by urban consumers and their responsiveness to structural factors such as relative fuel prices.

In spite of its multiple benefits; however, solar cookers have experienced little success. Curiously, there has been little discussion about this in academic circles. Most research concerns technical improvements of solar cookers, rather than on the reasons why these cookers are not actually adopted in the field. This paper fills the gap by developing a comprehensive list of variables that influence the adoption of solar cooking: (1) economic, (2) social, (3) cultural, (4) environmental, (5) political and (6) technical. Furthermore, we can see that some solar cooking promoters are able to control for some of the variables (e.g., environmental factors), but not others (e.g. technical, social and cultural factors).

Electrification programs, intended to connect new consumers countrywide, have not significantly contributed either to the intensification of electricity consumption or to the reduction of the use of biomass in households. The choice of energy source is dependent on price and on the capability of the household to invest in energy-consuming appliances. Based on the data from a household survey carried out in Mozambique during 2002/03, this paper analyzes the geographic differences in unit expenditures for domestic energy and finds evidence of an inverted energy ladder with prices of useful energy units. The data show that biomass sources are often more expensive per unit of useful energy than higher-grade sources, supporting arguments favoring electrification as a poverty alleviation strategy. In addition, this study estimates the likelihood of poor households transitioning from biomass to electricity consumption based on various factors.

Further analyses reveal that the energy transition effects generated by off-farm income are more pronounced for households in Shandong where the economy is relatively better developed relative to Henan and Gansu. Our findings highlight the importance of income diversification through off-farm activities by farm households to enhance clean energy accessibility and boost sustainable rural economic development.",127,,248-258,Off-farm income; Clean energy; Non-clean energy; Energy expenditures; China,

The results indicate that motor spirit premium (MSP), automotive gas oil (AGO) and lubricants are price elastic while fuel wood, kerosene, charcoal, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity are price inelastic. Kerosene is income elastic while fuel wood, charcoal, LPG, electricity, MSP and AGO are income inelastic. The results also reveal fuel stack behaviour, that is, multiple fuel use among the households. Main policy implications of the results include increasing the penetration of alternative fuels as well as provision of more fiscal incentives to increase usage of cleaner fuels. This not withstanding however, the household income should be increased beyond a certain point for the household to completely shift and use a new fuel.",39,11,7084-7094,Energy; Demand; LA-AIDS model,

The main fuel sources that we study are kerosene, charcoal, and firewood. These three accounted for 96.5% of spending on energy by households. Charcoal and firewood are used for cooking while kerosene is used for lighting and cooking. Kerosene is almost exclusively imported, while charcoal and firewood are produced domestically. These fuel sources are important, given the impacts of wood harvesting on the environment and kerosene imports on public finances. We find a statistically significant response in kerosene demand to charcoal prices, suggesting a pattern of substitution, but no strong substitution relationships between other fuel pairs. These results, which we use in a simulation of tariff change, imply that policies centered on price changes may not be effective in changing consumer behavior unless alternative sources of energy are readily accessible.",130,,243-252,Energy substitution; Cooking fuel; Tanzania,

No stove program can achieve its goals unless people initially accept the stoves and continue using them on a long-term basis. When a new stove is brought into a household, commonly a stacking of stoves and fuels takes place with each device being used for the cooking practices where it fits best. Therefore, to better understand the adoption process and assess the impacts of introducing a new stove it is necessary to examine the relative advantages of each device in terms of each of the main cooking practices and available fuels. An emerging generation of sensor-based tools is making possible continuous and objective monitoring of the stove adoption process (from acceptance to sustained use or disadoption), and has enabled its scalability. Such monitoring is also needed for transparent verification in carbon projects and for improved dissemination by strategically targeting the users with the highest adoption potential and the substitution of cooking practices with the highest indoor air pollution or greenhouse gas contributions.",39,12,7557-7566,Technology adoption; Biomass fuel; Monitoring and evaluation,

Drawing on material collected in Homa Bay and Kitui counties in 2016, the paper examines the gendered set-up, organisation and effects of solarpowered electricity access as compared with the central grid. The paper employs a framework for analysing women's empowerment through electrification, which draws on Kabeer, Friedman as well as anthropology, socio-technical system theory and practice theory. The results show that people tend to cherish solar-based solutions whereas the grid is perceived to be costly, unreliable and unavailable. As to the gendered organisation of supply, men dominate within the grid, mini-grids and private suppliers, leaving an important potential for women's empowerment untapped. Two community projects included women's ‚Äòhands-on' participation and spurred local discourses about women's capabilities. Access is also gendered on the user side.

We investigate differences between PV and EV adopter groups and the implications of these differences for the transition to smart energy systems. We study how socio-demographic characteristics of the consumer base influence regional diffusion patterns. In turn, we build scenarios to explore the influence of diffusion patterns on the viability of regional EV-PV integration in terms of energy use and regional self-consumption. The results point out large differences in the spatial diffusion patterns between EV and PV. These differences have implications for the transition to smart sustainable grids; vehicle-to-grid systems may not be viable for certain regions.",46,,68-85,Smart grids; Photovoltaic solar panels; Electric vehicles; Diffusion of; innovations; AGENT-BASED MODEL; MARKET PENETRATION; TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; SELF-CONSUMPTION; PV; PATTERNS; POWER; PREFERENCES; COMMUNITY; BARRIERS,

Indicators such as national electrification rates can mask significant inadequacies in supply, while delivering electricity for last-mile communities involves particular challenges. This paper presents a timely and important contribution by employing a novel mixed methods approach to understand the process and impacts of electrification in Choc??, a ‚Äòforgotten space' within Colombia. Choc?? is a densely forested, post-conflict region that is characterised by low socio-economic indicators. The paper examines the extent to which the benefits of electricity access have been realised for five villages in the municipality of Bahia Solano. A longitudinal study including surveys, interviews and a classification of households with the World Bank's Multi-Tier Framework provides insights into household energy use, expenditure and outcomes of the electrification process. Using these findings to define future demand scenarios, an energy system optimisation model was used to design a renewable micro-grid for the study villages revealing that distributed renewable energy systems can provide a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to grid extension. The research shows that the benefits of electrification cannot be assumed, particularly where programmes have a narrow focus on energy infrastructure alone. The delivery of electricity access is not a one-step intervention. It must involve ongoing engagement and consider the social, environmental, economic and political contexts in which people live. Only through this more grounded approach will the benefits of energy for sustainable development be realised.",59,,101302,Energy access; Colombia; Social research methods; Energy system optimisation model; Micro-grid; Multi-Tier Framework,

We analyse how socio-technical networks evolved over time in response to enabling policies and interest groups as well as opposition groups in four different bioenergy segments: solid biomass for district heating in Sweden, charcoal for iron and steel industry in Brazil, and ethanol for transport in both countries. The Swedish and Brazilian experiences illustrate the importance of coordinating policies between local and national levels and across sectors in order to advance modern bioenergy platforms. The focus on Sweden‚Äîan EU and global bioenergy pioneer‚Äîalong with Brazil‚Äîa recognised global biofuels leader‚Äîhelps to illustrate the linkages to regional and global markets that are important for European energy transitions.

We employ a qualitative approach of inquiry for data collection in three villages in Chittoor district in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The results presented in this paper are based on in-depth household interviews and focus group discussions. The findings suggest that cooking with solid fuels is intertwined with structural elements, such as established traditions, traditional income generating practices, gender norms, and a sense of belonging. These factors profoundly dominate households' decisions to continue using solid fuels despite the availability and the adoption of modern alternatives. The paper argues that interventions targeted at reducing the use of solid fuels may fail if they: 1) focus only on supplying modern fuels; 2) do not consider contextual social barriers; and 3) are implemented as standalone projects.",46,,225-235,Solid cooking fuels; Energy poverty; India; Adoption of modern fuels; Energy policy; ENERGY POVERTY; SOCIAL PRACTICE; TRANSITION; COOKSTOVES; RECRUITMENT; GENDER,

The deployment of solar energy has however remained limited. The complexity of these community-level transition processes has not been well understood and conceptualised. By advancing studies on community energy and socio-technical energy transitions, this paper proposes an integrated framework to conceptualise community-level energy initiatives from a systemic perspective. The framework builds the linkages among five critical processes and their associated contexts and outcomes, and is applied in a comparative study of two cities in Asia: Foshan and Seoul. Based on 19 semi-structured interviews in the case cities, this study has three major findings. First, the two cities' solarisation pathways exhibited similarities as well as differences that could be understood within our conceptual framework. Second, distinctive modes of community solarisation can be identified in the two cities. Foshan was a mixed mode which was characterised by a combination of top-down, state-led and entrepreneur-driven approaches, whereas Seoul developed a bottom-up grassroot-driven transition. Third, the actual impacts of community solarisation on regime shifts appeared to be very modest, but we identify important reinforcing effects between some processes and local contextual factors. This paper concludes that community energy can play an important role in urban energy transitions, but that sufficient policy attention must be given to complex interactions in the critical processes.",50,,129-142,Community solar energy; Urban socio-technical transitions; China; South; Korea; GRASS-ROOTS INNOVATIONS; LOW-CARBON INNOVATION; GERMANY; POWER; INTERMEDIARIES; PERSPECTIVE; LEADERSHIP; PATHWAYS; BARRIERS; NUCLEAR,

However, a range of challenges for community-based energy initiatives in developing countries are identified in the literature, often compromising the long-term operation of RE technologies and the sustainability of the project as a whole. Hence, questions arise around the set of community capabilities required, appropriate project design, and enabling external environment for sustainable Community RE (CRE) projects. Relatively longstanding CRE rural electrification experiences in Central America can offer useful insights on the challenges, capability requirements, and future perspectives for further deployment and governance of CRE initiatives in the developing world.

Despite this, the empirical evidence of what drives the initial purchase, and in particular, the continued use of advance cooking technologies remains limited. This paper describes two case studies in peri-urban Kiambu County (Kenya) and urban Lusaka (Zambia) where we examine the factors influencing the purchase and use of clean biomass cookstoves over time. We apply service design methodology to build ""user journeys"" to illustrate the cook's experience with the technology, from the point of hearing about it, to purchasing it, learning to use it, and making it part of their daily routine. We find that often, the primary factors influencing initial purchase do not motivate people to use the stove regularly in the longer term. From the user-journey mapping, we identify some key behaviour change techniques that could be applied, primarily by cookstove implementers, at different phases in the adoption journey to support users in the process of overcoming behavioural barriers to adopting a new technology. Our findings emphasize that complex factors affect people's decision-making around the purchase and use of clean cookstoves, and highlight the need to carefully map user's experience to pinpoint where support is most needed in the process of change.",39,,164-176,Clean cookstove technology; Behaviour change; Zambia; Kenya; User; journey; Service design; COOKING PRACTICES; ENERGY POVERTY; PREFERENCES; BENEFITS; STOVES; INTERVENTIONS; PROGRAM; HEALTH; INDIA,

In this article, we examine how U.S. communities have fared during the current transition toward lower carbon sources of energy. We analyze data compiled from interviews and surveys with stakeholders working in three locations: Detroit, Michigan; St. Louis, Missouri; and Appalachian coal country. We find that a majority of stakeholders perceive evidence of the energy transition in their communities and are concerned about their community's ability to adapt. Our results, however, suggest heterogeneity among perceptions across the study sites.

This framing is linked to how energy interventions are being imagined and constructed by key actors in the sector, via particular sociotechnical imaginaries through which a set of increasingly universalised energy futures for rural communities is prescribed. Projects are too frequently reverse-engineered through the lens of particular combinations of technologies, financial models and delivery mechanisms, rather than by attending to the particular energy needs/aspirations of individual communities. Assumptions over the association between energy access and livelihood enhancement have also reinforced a technocratic determination of appropriate system scale and a search for universalised ‚Äòscaleable' delivery models. There is, however, no necessary causation between scaleability and outcomes ‚Äì appropriate implementation scales are not purely determined by technical or financial considerations, rather it is the social scale via which optimum forms of local participation and ownership can be achieved.

Although a variety of models can be used to explain the adoption of energy management technologies and programs, they overlook the seemingly unconventional element of level of affiliation with nature. In fact, connectedness to nature has been identified as an important driver of many pro-environmental behaviors, but its role in pro-environmental technology adoption is also not well understood. Can affiliation with nature help to bridge the apparent gap-and complex chain of events-between sustainable technology adoption and protecting natural resources? Based on survey data from 856 southern California residents, this study investigated the influence of connectedness to nature and other factors on intentions to adopt five energy management technologies and programs: using three platforms to monitor home energy use (website, mobile phone application, in-home display); signing up for a time-of-use pricing plan; and participating in demand response events. Regression results showed that nature connectedness was the strongest predictor of all outcomes such that higher nature connectedness predicted greater likelihood of technology and program adoption. These findings suggest that connectedness to nature may facilitate ""bridging the logic gap"" between sustainable innovation adoption and environmental protection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the broader uptake of such systems is still at an early stage, research about the adoption potentials of DESs in existing neighborhood contexts is scarce. Given their potential to contribute to energy transitions, it is relevant to gain a better understanding of the conditions under which these systems are diffused. Based on a quantitative study, we investigated the perceived responsibilities and the intended technology uptake of DESs among different societal groups in Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. We analyzed a sample of 2104 survey participants who were exposed to ranking tasks and a framing experiment and were asked questions about both opportunities and challenges in implementing DESs. Our results show an openness to engage with DESs; on average, the opportunities in applying DESs are rated higher than the challenges. However, in all three countries, the participants place the responsibility for the energy system transitions on the national government and large energy supply utilities. Municipalities and households are not yet considered relevant innovators. Moreover, the support of DESs is found to be independent from framing the DES implementation in relation to different scales of rationale (global climate change, national energy independence, or local autarky). Our findings illustrate not only the agents' attitudes toward DESs but also the structural path dependencies involving the implementation of distributed energy technologies. Our study implies the need to address the willingness to invest in new distributed energy infrastructures at the household level in the future.

Nearly all are poor and a majority use traditional inefficient cookstoves that partially combust these fuels and emit harmful carbonaceous pollutants. These traditional cookstoves are a significant contributor to household air pollution, and causes acute public and environmental health implications. To reduce these detrimental effects, clean cooking technologies (clean stoves and clean fuels) have been distributed widely around the world, targeting poor communities. However, sustained uptake of these clean cooking technologies has been tepid. There has been considerable focus on improving the technical design and development of these clean cooking technologies, with less attention paid to the social drivers that either lead or keep people from using the stoves. We argue for greater emphasis on understanding social networks, and their influence on sustained uptake of clean cooking practices amongst poor communities.

In this article we deploy three different approaches to understanding the role of scale; namely locational, relational and strategic rescaling. For the past decade, multi-scalar interventions by CEFE have provided a platform for community energy generation projects, facilitated by the development of social infrastructure that engendered new ideas, interactions and potentials, engagement and participation. These interventions have transformed the region's multiple, multi-scalar geographies of community engagement, energy use and climate change. Analysing CEFE assists in thinking about the relational aspects of energy demand, supply and use, as well as the spatiality of political mobilisation. As a grassroots movement that subsequently tried to scale up and out its activities, CEFE also alerts us to the relational nature of both barriers and opportunities for any transition towards a low carbon economy. Perhaps most significantly, the example of CEFE demonstrates how existing notions of the geographies of energy in Australia can be challenged and transformed. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",36,,138-145,Community campaigns; Multi-scalar; Relational engagements; Social infrastructure,

This achievement seems to challenge the widely held assumption that poorer countries struggle to meet environmental objectives. This paper analyses the drivers and implications of Bulgaria's renewables expansion in order to test general expectations on influential factors shaping renewable energy transitions in the context of poor states. The analysis employs the energy justice framework to identify the justice, equity and fairness implications of Bulgaria's renewable energy for its energy system. Despite the clear justice implications raised by changing energy systems, there are limited pieces analysing the relationship between renewable energy transitions and energy justice. The analysis shows that whilst Bulgaria was able to reach its renewables targets, the mismanaged, opaque and corrupted policy framework undermines the longterm viability of its energy transition. The analysis confirms the importance of long term strategies, effective policies and a supportive macroeconomic context for renewable energy transitions, and highlights the negative implications of renewables to achieve greater energy justice if these factors are omitted. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",42,,44-52,Bulgaria; Corruption; Energy justice; Europe 2020 strategy; Renewable energy,

In terms of a country-wise microgrid market, the United States has the highest capacity share in the world. However, within the country, significant variation exists in the adoption of microgrids by the states. In this context, this paper presents an empirical analysis of the drivers behind high and low microgrid adoption in states across the United States. The results illustrate that the states that frequently experience disasters, and hence have high resilience concerns are more likely to adopt microgrids. On the other hand, higher citizen support for energy choice and pro-environmental attitudes of citizens do not have statistically significant effects on microgrid adoption. By examining the determinants of microgrid adoption in states, this paper provides a basis for understanding the socio-political foundations of the trend of decentralization in the energy system. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",49,,26-35,Decentralized energy systems; Energy democracy; Energy transition; Microgrids; Multi-level perspective framework; Resilience,

However, established equilibrium and optimisation models tend to radically simplify their depiction of societal and political/institutional actors. This can make them difficult to use for implementing specific energy and climate policies in the near term and aligning these with long term targets. Most energy systems analysis continues to pair such techno-economic models with entirely qualitative narratives about future political and societal developments. The result is that these critical factors often fade into the background in subsequent discourse. In this paper, we utilise BLUE ‚Äì a leading socio-technical energy transition (STET) model of the United Kingdom's (UK) energy system ‚Äì to capture elements of the heterogeneity, consistency and co-evolution of societal and political drivers. We focus specifically on exploring government-led and societally-led energy transitions and investigating the differences in their decarbonisation pathways and end states. Our modelling exercise finds that it is not who leads per se that is the most critical, but rather the level of the initial effort and subsequent commitment from both leader and follower actors that appears to regulate the pace at which decarbonisation pathways unfold. However, systemic inertia in all cases means that the deepest decarbonisation targets continue to appear very difficult to achieve. ¬© 2018",51,,67-81,Behaviour; Climate policy; Energy modelling; Socio-technical transitions,

Such socio-technical transitions offer substantive support to address energy poverty and act as a key tool to realise human well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental conservation envisioned under Sustainable development goals (SDGs). In this study, households using solar photovoltaic were surveyed to determine prospects of solar energy use in rural communities. The participants include rural households from Uttar Pradesh, India that had received i) a small scale and subsidised solar systems, ii) obtained paid connection from solar microgrids, and iii) those who purchased solar systems for power reliability. We report high satisfaction with distributed solar photovoltaic among rural households. The factors influencing a desire to procure additional solar power include income, level of education, duration of solar use, user satisfaction, time of day for the power supply and financial support for procurement. Our findings also suggest that freely given solar power offers limited incentives for procuring more solar power. We further analyse the policy of welfare using energy justice as a conceptual tool. This can explain paradoxical aspects of subsidies that are widely used as a socio-political tool to improve quality of life for those that are disadvantaged but fail to address fundamental structural aspects of the energy system that are underscored by procedural justice issues. We propose policies for distributed clean energy in emerging countries must address concurrent energy transitions and energy justice frameworks to support sustained decentralised solar transitions. Without these two foundations operating in tandem, carbon lock-in and the energy poverty cycle will be inexorably linked.",26,,100424,Clean energy access; Energy justice; Energy poverty; Rural communities; Subsidies,

To achieve this objective, the EU has explicitly stated targets for greenhouse reduction, shares of renewable energy sources (RES), and energy efficiency improvements for 2020 and 2030. In this paper, we focus on the drivers, barriers and enablers to achieving the EU's RES targets (20% by 2020 and 27% by 2030). Effective energy policies play a key role in the deployment of RES technologies. In order to design effective policies, a clear understanding of past trends and projections for future deployment is required. In this paper, we first analyse the past deployment of RES technologies for electricity supply (RES-E) in selected EU Member States. This highlights the key drivers, barriers, and enablers for deployment of RES in the past. In a second step, we conduct a meta-analysis of projections for RES-E shares from multiple well-established studies. Such an analysis will help in supporting the design of more effective energy policies and successfully achieving the EU's energy targets. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",26,,,Energy policy; EU targets; meta-Analysis; Renewable energy; Energy efficiency; Renewable energy resources; Effective energy; Electricity supply; Energy efficiency improvements; Low-carbon energy systems; Meta analysis; Renewable energies; Renewable energy deployments; Renewable energy source,

The analysis indicates that energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies are the core elements of that transition, and their synergies are likewise important. Favourable economics, ubiquitous resources, scalable technology, and significant socio-economic benefits underpin such a transition. Renewable energy can supply two-thirds of the total global energy demand, and contribute to the bulk of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction that is needed between now and 2050 for limiting average global surface temperature increase below 2‚ÄØ¬?C. Enabling policy and regulatory frameworks will need to be adjusted to mobilise the six-fold acceleration of renewables growth that is needed, with the highest growth estimated for wind and solar PV technologies, complemented by a high level of energy efficiency. Still, to ensure the eventual elimination of carbon dioxide emissions will require new technology and innovation, notably for the transport and manufacturing sectors, which remain largely ignored in the international debate.

Still, the cost can be substantial and many cases remain where policy intervention is justified to address concerns of both equity and efficiency. Addressing the coping capabilities of the very poor and the open access conditions of woodlands appear to be two ways of dealing with fuelwood scarcity that are likely to yield high social rates of return.

Focusing on developers, key stakeholders largely hidden in the extant research literature and the perspectives of other stakeholders drawn from secondary sources, this paper presents original primary research to help fill this knowledge gap. Based on semi-structured interviews with established and active developers in the Province, we find that feed-in tariffs have arguably been the strongest driver of developers successfully getting turbines up and running. Yet, legislative and policy attempts to reduce delays and smooth the development process have often complicated the development process. Developers recognise and often agree with community viewpoints that the process as framed by Ontario's policy environment forestalls cooperative development, particularly with respect to community engagement. While developers are supportive of better community engagement, they feel constrained by policy-related barriers. Findings from the study show that communities will only be engaged in projects to the full extent possible if developers take the initiative to transcend regulatory requirements for public engagement.

However, due to prevailing high price of non-edible oilseeds, such as Jatropha curcas, the cost of electricity generation is very high. This paper provides detailed financial analysis of straight vegetable oil (SVO)-based decentralized power project and proposes an innovative model for enhancing their financial viability. While for implementing agency operational cost recovery is the key for viability, affordable tariff is crucial for end-users. The paper attempts to estimate minimum desired price of electricity from the stakeholders' (producer and users) perspective using data gathered from selected operational SVO-based power generation projects in India. Analysis carried out in this paper indicates that operating the decentralized power plant at higher capacity utilization factor, by introduction of productive load, and differentiated tariffs for commercial and domestic consumers may not alone be sufficient to achieve the financial viability. The paper proposes an innovative integrated model of using biogas, obtained from the by-product de-oiled cake of non-edible oilseeds, as a feedstock for power generation, instead of using the SVO in engines. This reduces the fuel cost of power generation, thereby helping to bring down the tariff within the paying capacity of rural consumers. The main produce, viz. extracted non-edible oil, which was otherwise used as fuel for generating power, can be sold in local market for earning revenue, thereby enhancing the project's economic viability. This paper sets forth the proposed integrated model as a viable biofuel-based decentralized power project for sustainable rural development in areas with adequate availability of oilseeds.",19,1,263-283,biofuels; biogas; decentralization; economic viability; electricity generation; electricity supplies; energy sources; models; prices; rural areas,

Despite the practical advantages of WtE and its well-established status abroad, in Australia at present, no commercial-scale plants processing municipal solid waste exist. This article examines the causal factors behind this apparent anomaly, comparing Australia to the world-leader in WtE, France, and contends that an abundance of space for low-cost landfills, lack of political will and community distrust of regulators has resulted in Australia's failure to capitalise on the potential of this technology to contribute towards the solution to the energy and waste problems.",36,3,262-276,,

However, in the wake of the 2015 Paris Agreement, a range of international initiatives have emerged that focus on enhancing the positive role of the private sector in energy transition governance. These developments reinforce a gradual international shift in the business community to view climate change in financial risk terms. Climate change seen as a matter of financial risk for corporations, and for the large institutional investors who invest in them, has the potential to engage corporate law tools, such as requirements for risk disclosure, shareholder actions and the fiduciary duties of company directors. This article explores the potential, and limitations, of such corporate law tools to drive private sector action on sustainable energy transition. The article draws on empirical research examining business perceptions and practices relating to climate risk management and promotion of clean energy sources. Although there are promising signs of a more serious consideration of climate risk in business decision-making, corporate practices around climate risk disclosure, and shareholder and board engagement with clean energy issues, remain highly variable and in flux.

This study takes a qualitative approach and actors-based perspective from the major players at the supply-side of the clean cooking on biomass market sector. A field research in Kampala (Uganda) explored the success factors according to local private actors' perceptions. The confrontation between these perceptions and a literature-based success-factor framework revealed original insights in terms of enabling conditions to strengthen the supply-side, related to the demand-side and the clean cooking market. First, becoming a ‚Äòclean cooking champion' is still highly dependent on the role of supportive and intervening development programs, especially in terms of financing, capacity-building, and awareness-raising. Second, up to now, carbon finance is an additional incentive rather than a determining factor for business activities in the clean cooking sector. Third, while some policies and targets exist, private sector respondents lament the lack of a level playing field and the competition of the informal cooking sector. Thus, this research provides an empirical basis for a possible approach to leverage private sector experience and expertise to improve access to clean cooking on biomass in Uganda.",,,100452,Clean cooking; Local private sector; Development programs; Carbon finance; Uganda,

Reducing the resulting adverse health, environmental, and development consequences will involve transitioning through a mix of clean fuels and improved solid fuel stoves (IS) of demonstrable effectiveness. To date, achieving uptake of IS has presented significant challenges. Objectives: We performed a systematic review of factors that enable or limit large-scale uptake of IS in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: We conducted systematic searches through multidisciplinary databases, specialist websites, and consulting experts. The review drew on qualitative, quantitative, and case studies and used standardized methods for screening, data extraction, critical appraisal, and synthesis. We summarized our findings as ""factors"" relating to one of seven domains-fuel and technology characteristics; household and setting characteristics; knowledge and perceptions; finance, tax, and subsidy aspects; market development; regulation, legislation, and standards; programmatic and policy mechanisms- and also recorded issues that impacted equity. Results: We identified 31 factors influencing uptake from 57 studies conducted in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. All domains matter. Although factors such as offering technologies that meet household needs and save fuel, user training and support, effective financing, and facilitative government action appear to be critical, none guarantee success: All factors can be influential, depending on context. The nature of available evidence did not permit further prioritization. Conclusions: Achieving adoption and sustained use of IS at a large scale requires that all factors, spanning household/community and program/societal levels, be assessed and supported by policy. We propose a planning tool that would aid this process and suggest further research to incorporate an evaluation of effectiveness.",122,2,120-130,"carbon monoxide; domestic chemical; fuel; air pollution; cooking; drug legislation; energy conservation; environmental planning; equipment; government; health program; household; human; income; large scale production; marketing; particulate matter; policy; priority journal; qualitative research; quality control; quantitative study; review; social support; solid; solid fuel stove; systematic review; tax; Air Pollution, Indoor; Biofuels; Developing Countries; Family Characteristics; Food Technology; Government Regulation; Humans",

However, ICS and clean fuel dissemination programs have met with low rates of adoption. OBJECTIVES: We reviewed empirical studies on ICSs and fuel choice to describe the literature, examine determinants of fuel and stove choice, and identify knowledge gaps. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the adoption of ICSs or cleaner fuels by households in developing countries. Results are synthesized through a simple vote-counting meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified 32 research studies that reported 146 separate regression analyses of ICS adoption (11 analyses) or fuel choice (135 analyses) from Asia (60%), Africa (27%), and Latin America (19%). Most studies apply multivariate regression methods to consider 7-13 determinants of choice. Income, education, and urban location were positively associated with adoption in most but not all studies. However, the influence of fuel availability and prices, household size and composition, and sex is unclear. Potentially important drivers such as credit, supply-chain strengthening, and social marketing have been ignored. CONCLUSIONS: Adoption studies of ICSs or clean energy are scarce, scattered, and of differential quality, even though global distribution programs are quickly expanding. Future research should examine an expanded set of contextual variables to improve implementation of stove programs that can realize the ""win-win-win"" of health, local environmental quality, and climate associated with these technologies.",120,5,637-645,adoption regressions; fuel choice; fuel switching; improved cookstove; indoor air pollution; systematic review; INDOOR AIR-POLLUTION; PUBLIC-HEALTH; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; DOMESTIC; FUEL; ENERGY USE; HOUSEHOLD; DIFFUSION; COOKING; DEMAND; CHOICE,

In recent years an increasing number of innovations in on-site systems have been developed, which have not yet evolved into fully functional alternatives to the existing regimes. We study three prominent recent on-site sanitation initiatives in informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya that aimed at developing entire ‚Äúsanitation value chains‚Äù, which we conceptualize as an emerging Technological Innovation System (TIS). The analysis leads us to propose alternative governance modes for the TIS to overcome system failures such as capability, coordination and institutional barriers.

Despite political efforts to shift to a sustainable energy system, the Netherlands is lagging behind other European countries. Scholarly literature generally ascribes such slow developments to the dominant role of incumbents. In this paper we explore how prominent incumbents of the Dutch energy system discursively frame the energy transition by unravelling their existing and evolving storylines. Our results show that decarbonization in the context of a European energy market is currently seen as the dominant driver for the energy transition, linked to discursive elements on keeping the energy supply secure and affordable. We found tensions within this dominant storyline and emerging storylines with the potential to undermine the dominant one. In response, incumbents are discursively repositioning themselves, thereby restructuring coalitions - possibly indicating discursive regime destabilization. ¬© 2014 The Authors.",13,,45-59,Destabilization; Discourse; Energy transition; Regime; The Netherlands; energy planning; energy resource; environmental policy; political process; sustainability; Netherlands,

Aim and objectives: To systematically appraise the current evidence base to identify: (i) which factors enable or limit adoption and sustained use of clean fuels (namely liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biogas, solar cooking and alcohol fuels) in low- and middle-income countries; (ii) lessons learnt concerning equitable scaling-up of programmes of cleaner cooking fuels in relation to poverty, urban-rural settings and gender. Methods: A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted using established review methodology and extensive searches of published and grey literature sources. Data extraction and quality appraisal of quantitative, qualitative and case studies meeting inclusion criteria were conducted using standardised methods with reliability checking. Findings: Forty-four studies from Africa, Asia and Latin America met the inclusion criteria (17 on biogas, 12 on LPG, 9 on solar, 6 on alcohol fuels). A broad range of inter-related enabling and limiting factors were identified for all four types of intervention, operating across seven pre-specified domains (i.e. fuel and technology characteristics, household and setting characteristics, knowledge and perceptions, financial, tax and subsidy aspects, market development, regulation, legislation and standards, and programme and policy mechanisms) and multiple levels (i.e. household, community, national). All domains matter and the majority of factors are common to all clean fuels interventions reviewed although some are fuel and technology-specific. All factors should therefore be taken into account and carefully assessed during planning and implementation of any small- and large-scale initiative aiming at promoting clean fuels for household cooking. Conclusions: Despite limitations in quantity and quality of the evidence this systematic review provides a useful starting point for the design, delivery and evaluation of programmes to ensure more effective adoption and use of LPG, biogas, alcohol fuels and solar cooking.

Although much progress has been made on the technical aspects, sustained and proper use of clean cooking technologies by populations with the most need has been problematic. Only by understanding how clean cooking as an intervention is embedded within complex community processes can we ensure its sustained implementation. Using a community-based system dynamics approach, we engaged two rural communities in co-creating a dynamic model to explain the processes influencing the uptake and transition to sustained use of biogas (an anaerobic methane digester), a clean fuel and cooking technology. The two communities provided contrasting cases: one abandoned biogas while the other continues to use it. We present a system dynamics simulation model, associated analyses, and experiments to understand what factors drive transition and sustained use. A central insight of the model is community processes influencing the capacity to solve technical issues. Model analysis shows that families begin to abandon the technology when it takes longer to solve problems. The momentum in the community then shifts from a determination to address issues with the cooking technology toward caution in further adhering to it. We also conducted experiments using the simulation model to understand the impact of interventions aimed at renewing the use of biogas. A combination of theoretical interventions, including repair of non-functioning biogas units and provision of embedded technical support in communities, resulted in a scenario where the community can continue using the technology even after support is retracted. Our study also demonstrates the utility of a systems approach for engaging local stakeholders in delineating complex community processes to derive significant insights into the dynamic feedback mechanisms involved in the sustained use of biogas by the poor.",13,3,35010,bioenergy; biofuels; biogas; cooking; renewable energy; rural areas; simulation models,

Major national initiatives implemented by the Indian government over the last few decades have included subsidies for cleaner burning fuels like liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene to encourage a transition to these. However, the extent to which these programs have affected net emissions from the use of these improved fuels has not been adequately studied. Here, we estimate the amount of fuelwood displaced and its net emissions impact due to improved access to LPG for cooking in India between 2001 and 2011 using nationally representative household expenditure surveys and census datasets. We account for a suite of climate-relevant emissions (Kyoto gases and other short-lived climate pollutants) and biomass renewability scenarios (a fully renewable and a conservative non-renewable case). We estimate that the national fuelwood displaced due to increased LPG access between 2001 and 2011 was approximately 7.2 million tons. On aggregate, we estimate a net emissions reduction of 6.73 MtCO2e due to the fuelwood displaced from increased access to LPG, when both Kyoto and non-Kyoto climate-active emissions are accounted for and assuming 0.3 as the fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB) harvested. However, if only Kyoto gases are considered, we estimate a smaller net emissions decrease of 0.03 MtCO2e (assuming fully renewable biomass harvesting), or 3.05 MtCO2e (assuming 0.3 as the fNRB). We conclude that the transition to LPG cooking in India reduced pressures on forests and achieved modest climate benefits, though uncertainties regarding the extent of non-renewable biomass harvesting and suite of climate-active emissions included in such an estimation can significantly influence results in any given year and should be considered carefully in any analysis and policy-making.",12,11,115003,,

We observed >90% reductions in most pollutant emission factors/rates from pellet stoves compared to baseline stoves. Pellet stoves performed far better than gasifier stoves burning unprocessed wood, and consistent with ISO tiers 4 and 5 for PM2.5 and CO, respectively. Pellet stoves were generally clean, but performance varied; emissions from the dirtiest pellet tests matched those from the cleanest traditional stove tests. Our real-time data suggest that events occurring during ignition and the end of testing (e.g., refueling, char burnout) drive high emissions during pellet tests. We use our data to estimate potential health and climate cobenefits from stove adoption.

This study investigates the role Kenya's household energy consumers in urban and rural areas can play in adopting renewable energy technologies. To achieve this, a questionnaire survey was administered among 250 household consumers in Nairobi County, Makueni County, and Uasin Gishu County. Our survey analysis shows that about 84% of the respondents were interested in adopting renewable energy for their entire energy consumption mostly because of solving frequent power outages and high energy cost from the grid system. This perception did not have any correlations with income levels or any other socio-economic factors we identified. Furthermore, about 72% of the respondents showed their interests in producing and selling renewable energy to the national or local grids if government subsidies were readily available. Rural residents showed strong interests in adopting renewable energy technologies, especially solar PV solutions.

Methods: A quasi-experimental design was conducted from July 2016 to September 2016. The model targeted 10 PHC units out of 23 at Tamia district, with two types of interventions; health sector and non-health sector related interventions carried out in the intervention units and their catchment areas. The family planning utilization of the intervention units (n=10) was compared to the control units (n=13). Additionally, the overall family planning utilization at the district level was measured. Results: Following the implementation of the interventions, the overall family planning utilization at the district level showed a significant increase in mean ¬± Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) of new family planning clients (44.4¬±11.0vs. 63.3¬±13.8; P= 0.006) recording 43% change.

Using a series of three case studies on ICRISAT's Groundnut Production Technology, the process of technology uptake leading to empowerment is systematically documented through three stages of the adoption pathway. The process stimulating gender-equitable change and empowerment was examined through a sequential analysis using two in-depth case studies in three villages in Maharashtra, India, and complemented by a broader quantitative study of the uptake process covering villages in surrounding districts. This analysis illustrated that social capital is important for both adoption and impact to occur. Qualitative information complemented by quantitative measures provides a holistic understanding of the long-term effects and benefits. The findings illustrated that build-up of social capital improves access to resources like credit, information and knowledge about new technology options and practices. Furthermore, it expands choices available to each household member - e.g. selecting and adopting seed technology of their choice, and alternative investment options - and influences the distribution of benefits from the technology because of the ways in which social networks and social relationships facilitate technology dissemination.

Second, global examples of regional infrastructure projects include green growth-supportive conditions that, if considered during project conceptualisation, could increase the chances for a transition to green economies. Third, capacity building in technical areas, more generally in financing, could increase the potential for regional coordination and project implementation. Fourth, inclusive stakeholder engagement can result in strong stakeholder support and the eventual promotion of green economies and green infrastructure.

Biomass can supply heat and electricity, liquid and gaseous fuels. A number of developed countries derive a significant amount of their primary energy from biomass: USA 4%, Finland 18%, Sweden 16% and Austria 13%. Presently, biomass energy supplies at least 2 EJ/year in Western Europe which is about 4% of primary energy (54 EJ). Estimates show a likely potential in Europe in 2050 of 9.0-13.5 EJ depending on land areas (10% of useable land, 33 Mha), yields (10-15 oven-dry tonnes (ODt)/ha), and recoverable residues (25% of potentially harvestable residues). This biomass contribution represents 17-30% of projected total energy requirements up to 2050. The relative contribution of biofuels in the future will depend on markets and incentives, on continuous research and development progress, and on environmental requirements. Land constraints are not considered significant because of the predicted surpluses to land and food, and the near balance in wood and wood products in Europe. There is considerable potential for the modernization of biomass fuels to produce convenient energy such as electricity, gases and transportation fuels, while continuing to provide for traditional uses of biomass; this modernization of biomass and the industrial investment is already happening in many countries. When produced in an efficient and sustainable manner, biomass energy has numerous environmental and social benefits compared with fossil fuels. These include improved land management, job creation, use of surplus agricultural land in industrialized countries, provision of modern energy carriers to rural communities of developing countries, a reduction of CO2 levels, waste control, and nutrient recycling. Greater environmental and net energy benefits can be derived from perennial and woody energy cropping than from annual arable crops which are short-term alternative feedstocks for fuels. Agroforestry systems can play an important role in providing multiple benefits to growers and the community, beside energy. In order to ameliorate CO2 emissions, using biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels (complete replacement, co-firing, etc.) is more beneficial from social and economic perspectives than sequestering the carbon in forests. Case studies are presented for several developed countries (Finland, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, USA, OECD Europe Countries) and the constraints involved in modernizing biomass energy along with the potential for turning them into entrepreneurial opportunities are discussed. It is concluded that the long-term impacts of biomass programmes and projects depend mainly on ensuring income generation, environmental sustainability, flexibility and replicability, while taking account of local conditions and providing multiple benefits, which is an important attribute of agroforestry-type systems.

This paper addresses the public perception of different pathways to energy transition, and their mental representation in particular. A study is reported that employed card sorting to explore how laypeople categorize possible pathway components with respect to their perceived similarity (Norwegian sample, n = 61; German sample, n = 71). Data sets that were obtained by this method were subjected to multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis. Results for both samples consistently indicate that people differentiate components located at the individual level (e.g., vegetarian food, avoid long flights, walking and cycling), components located at the societal level (e.g., taxes, regulations, urban planning), and components concerned with technological solutions (e.g., hydropower, wind farms, solar panels). These results give reason to assume that laypeople from Norway and Germany share a multifaceted understanding of energy transition, yet some differences between samples were present with regard to the substructure of the individual level category. Future research can build on the present results to explore the subjective meanings of these structures, possibly identifying barriers to public engagement with energy transition. ¬© 2018 Doran, B??hm and Hanss.",9,DEC,,Card sorting; Climate change; Cross-national; Energy transition; Germany; Mental representation; Norway; Perceived similarity,

It examines use of multiple fuels by households in some detail, a topic not much explored in the household fuel-choice literature in general, and in sub-Saharan Africa in particular. The results suggest that as householdsâ€™ total expenditures rise, they increase the number of fuels used, even in urban areas, and they also spend more on the fuels they consume (including charcoal but not wood). The results also show that even fuel types such as wood are not inferior goods. The results support more recent arguments in the literature (using Latin American and Asian data) that multiple fuel use (fuel stacking) better describes fuel-choice behavior of households in developing countries, as opposed to the idea that households switch (completely) to other (more expensive but cleaner) fuels as their incomes rise. This study shows the relevance of fuel stacking (multiple fuel use) in urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa. While income is an important variable, the results of this study suggest the need to consider other variables such as cooking and consumption habits, dependability of supply, cost, and household preferences and tastes to explain household fuel choice, as well as to recommend policies that address issues associated with household energy use.",36,,,,

It was found that the characteristics of the soil nature have determinant influence to extrapolate results obtained in the bench scale tests. It is suggested that the presence of natural species in the soil, constituting a complex matrix, could interfere in the biological degradation process of the diesel pollutant. Regarding the scale-up, it was observed that electro-bioremediation can be applied successfully at different scales and results show that it works, although the rates are strongly influenced by the size due to the very complex scale-up.

A complex assemblage of factors, embedded within prevailing inequities and inequalities, continue to betray efforts to improve this. Subsidy-based projects have had little impact in rural Africa where sanitation remains under-prioritised by the state and donors. Community-led total sanitation (CLTS) offers a new, people-centric approach conceptually grounded in participatory development. But despite its broad appeal, the CLTS policy narrative has become equated with quick results, low-cost, provocative language and the potential for community self-help. Drawing on research in Katete district, Eastern Zambia, this paper explores tensions between CLTS theory, policy, practice and local realities. Rapidly scaled-up by local government, poor management and stakeholder engagement effectively diluted the approach, and continued the ""projectification"" of the sanitation sector. Open defecation, both symbolically and practically, represented an embedded marginalisation from the modern Zambian state where multiple barriers to latrine construction coexisted in the context of fragile livelihoods. In such agrarian communities, CLTS cannot be conceptualised as a blanket approach quickly bringing total sanitation to the masses. For its strengths to be realised in contexts of rural poverty, a targeted strategy that builds local institutional capacity and iteratively scales-up over time is needed. But realising this in practice requires moving beyond a prevailing emphasis on ""open defecators"" to engage complex issues of power and politics in sanitation governance. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",66,,53-63,Community-led total sanitation; Health; Participation; Zambia; governance approach; marginalization; participatory approach; poverty; power relations; rural area; sanitation; Eastern Province [Zambia]; Katete,

My inquiry is inspired by the question posed by James Ferguson and Tania Murray Li: what do development schemes do? I analyse a renewable energy pilot project in Tanzania that was implemented by an NGO, which eventually failed to continue its service delivery but still produced important effects. Conceptually, I build on and extend previous arguments about how development projects produce depoliticizing effects, have ambiguous effects, and reproduce unequal relations of power. Building on feminist and sociotechnical relational approaches to power, I identify when and where in the encounter between energy project and local community that these, and other, effects emerge. Case study data was collected by qualitative methodology, and consists of project documentation, observation, and interviews with actors involved. The study shows how particular material, social, emotional, and economic effects emerged from the encounter between the project and local society. Feedback between technical problems, financial difficulties, and social tensions created a downward spiral resulting in system failure. It had negative effects on the credibility of actors and on trust relations. I argue that asking what decentralized electrification schemes actually 'do' can provide insight relevant to energy geography, as the focus on effects reveals the sociotechnical and political relations through which electricity becomes possible and how it may reconfigure local places. The case study shows why and how a small-scale, renewable energy project only temporarily repositioned actors and places, produced ambiguous effects, and maintained unequal power relations.",97,,268-280,case studies; constraints; development projects; electrification; emotions; politics; renewable energy; rural communities; rural development; socioeconomics; sustainability,

While technological solutions exist, widespread adoption has been slow due to various barriers to transition at the household level.

However, it has been difficult to motivate older adults to adopt and use these new technologies. Therefore, it is crucial to better understand not only the role of personal drivers but also the family influences on older adults. Objective: This research goes beyond traditional technology acceptance theories by investigating the role of personal (e.g., inherent novelty seeking) and interpersonal drivers (e.g., influence of family) in stimulating older adults to use gerontechnologies. Nine hypotheses, building on traditional and new technology acceptance theories, were developed and tested. Methods: This research applies a cross-sectional study design. Therefore, a face-to-face survey instrument was developed building on a qualitative pilot study and validated scales. Three hundred and four older adults (minimum age = 70 years) were willing to participate as well as one of their family members. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the hypothesized conceptual model. Results: Our results extend the seminal technology acceptance theories by adding personal (i.e., inherent novelty seeking p = 0.017) and interpersonal drivers. More specifically, it was found that the attitude toward gerontechnologies was influenced by family tech savviness (i.e., people who often use technology), as this relationship is fully mediated through the social norms of older adults (p = 0.014). The same was found for older adults' trust in the family member's technology knowledge (p ‚â§ 0.001). Here, the relationship with older adults' attitude toward gerontechnologies was partially mediated by the older adults' trust in technology. Conclusion: This study identified important personal and interpersonal drivers that influence attitudes toward and intentions to use gerontechnologies. To foster technology acceptance among older adults, it was found that it is important to strengthen the trust in and the attitude toward gerontechnologies. Furthermore, family members' knowledge and beliefs in technology were the keys to promoting the actual use of gerontechnologies among older adults. Furthermore, the families' trust in gerontechnologies and the provision of access to technology can improve their attitudes toward technology and usage intentions for the older relative. ¬© 2019 S.

Currently, the percentage of population with access to energy varies significantly between countries and across regions. This is due to the nature of national socio-economic situations and energy resource availability in differing settings. This article addresses issues and hindrances to energy access in regional contexts and also examines, in particular, the prospects of how regional cooperation initiatives linked with climate change mitigation objectives could assist in widening energy access. Existing relevant regional cooperation initiatives that may be upscaled or used as models to widen access to modern energy services are evaluated. Findings are that regional cooperation initiatives linked with climate change mitigation can potentially facilitate widening energy access. However, in order to realise such potential, synergies from regional cooperation that are indirectly linked to energy and wider climate change mitigation programs should be harnessed. Recommendations are made for development of sustainable energy programs in energy deprived regions that will also mitigate climate change impacts.",35,,497-504,Energy access; Regions; Mitigation; Climate change; Regional cooperation,

One way to accelerate progress would be through the large-scale implementation of evidence-based health tools and interventions. This study aimed to: (a) explore the barriers that have impeded such scale-up in LMICs, and (b) lay out an "" implementation research agenda"" -a series of key research questions that need to be addressed in order to help overcome such barriers.Methods: Interviews were conducted with fourteen key informants, all of whom are academic leaders in the field of implementation science, who were purposively selected for their expertise in scaling up in LMICs. Interviews were transcribed by hand and manually coded to look for emerging themes related to the two study aims. Barriers to scaling up, and unanswered research questions, were organized into six categories, representing different components of the scaling up process: attributes of the intervention; attributes of the implementers; scale-up approach; attributes of the adopting community; socio-political, fiscal, and cultural context; and research context.Results: Factors impeding the success of scale-up that emerged from the key informant interviews, and which are areas for future investigation, include: complexity of the intervention and lack of technical consensus; limited human resource, leadership, management, and health systems capacity; poor application of proven diffusion techniques; lack of engagement of local implementers and of the adopting community; and inadequate integration of research into scale-up efforts.Conclusions: Key steps in expanding the evidence base on implementation in LMICs include studying how to: simplify interventions; train "" scale-up leaders"" and health workers dedicated to scale-up; reach and engage communities; match the best delivery strategy to the specific health problem and context; and raise the low profile of implementation science. ¬© 2012 Yamey; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",8,,,"academic research; health care; health education; health status; health worker; income distribution; qualitative analysis; article; coding; community; cultural factor; developing country; evidence based practice; health care management; health care organization; health care personnel; health care planning; health service; human; integration; interview; leadership; lowest income group; medical research; politics; priority journal; qualitative research; scale up; social aspect; health care policy; health care quality; health services research; mass communication; nonbiological model; organization; poverty; standard; Developing Countries; Diffusion of Innovation; Evidence-Based Practice; Health Plan Implementation; Health Planning; Health Policy; Health Priorities; Health Resources; Health Services; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Models, Organizational; Organizational Objectives; Quality Assurance, Health Care",

LCTs of nine plans under INDC are identified such as current status and future directions of LCTs, analysis on LCTs and the gap, specific features for international support and domestic efforts related to LCTs, and the assessment of anticipated impacts and benefits for economic, social, and environmental sectors. Barriers and challenges for diffusion of LCTs to achieve INDC targets depend on commitment of involving ministries and progress in 2015-2016, progress of implementation of plans (technical cooperation for moving MRV of LCTs, new technology promotion, and self-assessment tool), and key drivers for continuing the implementation (plan and budget or expense, support of Energy Conservation Fund, energy-efficient technology, and co-benefit thinking system). To ensure economic growth with LCTs deployment, Thailand has implemented Industry 4.0 Policy and other support programs (Talent Mobility Program and STEM Program) and is planning to implement other development projects and policies such as Special Economic Zones in Thailand, Eastern Economic Corridor Development Project, Smart Grid Technology, and Carbon Tax. Lastly, this article discusses regional and international technology cooperation that accelerates trade and investment, funding support and implementation of LCTs such as energy connectivity with neighbor countries, low-carbon zone to attract foreign investments, technology cooperation to scale up renewable energy technologies, partnership for capacity building, and enhancement of Thailand's Energy Conservation (ENCON) Fund to the regional level. ¬© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,193-240,Springer Singapore,,

The main goal of this study is to illuminate the fact that providing energy to an ever-growing population of the globe during a period of transition, and so doing in a responsible manner, requires a sustainable energy mix of fossils and renewables. Given the fact that the energy solution of tomorrow has to combine various fuels and technologies, different solutions will be needed for different regions, as determined in line with various factors, including the availability of resources and specific needs. Consequently, the role of gas-fuelled solutions as part of the transition towards future sustainable energy world needs to be illuminated from a technical, economic, social, political and geographical point of view. The discussions and conclusions presented in the chapter support the expectation of the increased use of natural gas as a part of the global transition towards a low-carbon energy society. From a carbon-neutral energy perspective, however, the use of biogas and renewable-based hydrogen as replacement for natural gas, in the long-term perspective, could be expected. In this way, natural gas will be an important complement to renewable energy during the transition period. Infrastructure and energy conversion technologies developed for natural gas need to be designed in such a way so as to be able to cope with the transition towards biogas and renewable supported hydrogen. Moreover, small-scale combined heat- and electricity-production and distributed generation could be a potential gas-fuelled solution, providing an improved fuel utilisation factor and, as a result, reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. Taking into account the challenges of the increasing demand for reliable and affordable energy, as well as global climate change, it is concluded that common understanding needs to be established amongst all the players, including society, industries, strategists, decision-makers, politicians and environmentalists, so as to reach a new level of commitment and partnership. ¬© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.",,,,Jan-33,

However, little research to date has investigated the application of green technologies as well as green strategies in achieving low-carbon communities. This paper first reviewed low-carbon technologies and strategies in the previous literatures and then examines how these technologies and strategies are addressed in two ongoing low-carbon communities. By comparing the differences of adopting various low-carbon technologies and strategies in the two cases, it is found that green strategies are not as valued as green technologies in the current stage of low-carbon communities in China. The ten One Planet Living principles are not fully considered and comprehensively implemented, and there is also lack of a clear and harmonious inter-sector working mechanism within and between energy, transport, waste management and water management sectors. Recommendations are proposed to provide a vehicle for a more effective and efficient use of green technologies as well as green strategies to reduce carbon emissions in low-carbon communities. Research findings in the study may therefore provide valuable references to guide low-carbon community development. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Data collection occurred over a nine month period (August 2008-April 2009). Twenty in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals from four stakeholders groups: (i) MSAC members and evaluators, (ii) academic and health technology assessment experts, (iii) medical industry representatives and (iv) medical specialists. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and coded using a constant comparative method. Results: Respondents expressed a consensus opinion that the MSAC process is generally fair and transparent, and has been increasingly so over time. The process was described as "" flexible"" and "" intuitive"" yet also "" idiosyncratic"" due to the nature of the technologies being appraised. Approval by MSAC was generally reported to be increasingly important once a technology becomes more widely used. While successful MSAC approval was felt to be important for widespread distribution of a new technology, it was viewed more as a "" facilitator of the uptake of new technologies"" as opposed to a primary "" driver"" of technology uptake. Instead, other factors were identified as providing the actual impetus for the uptake of new technologies, with MSAC approval and reimbursement eventually helping facilitate more widespread diffusion. Conclusions: MSAC's decision making process is perceived as fair but with room for improvement. Its role in the uptake and diffusion of new medical technologies in Australia is limited. MSAC does not act as a barrier to significant market penetration of new procedures and medical technologies. However reimbursement is a trigger for increased use. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",102,43526,152-158,"Australia; HTA; Medical technologies; MSAC; National level; article; attitude to health; decision making; evidence based practice; health care organization; health care system; human; medical specialist; medical technology; perception; qualitative analysis; semi structured interview; Advisory Committees; Decision Making, Organizational; Diffusion of Innovation; Health Services Research; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Technology Assessment, Biomedical",

Recent research on key interventions-the adoption and use of relatively cheap and effective environmental health technologies-has focused primarily on the influence of demand-side household-level drivers. Relatively few studies of the promotion and use of these technologies have considered the role of contextual factors such as governance, the enabling environment and national policies because of the challenges of cross-country comparisons. We exploit a natural experimental setting by comparing household adoption across the Benin-Togo national border that splits the Tamberma Valley in West Africa. Households across the border share the same culture, ethnicity, weather, physiographic features, livelihoods and infrastructure; however, they are located in countries at virtually opposite ends of the institutional spectrum of democratic elections, voice and accountability, effective governance and corruption. Binary choice models and rigorous non-parametric matching estimators confirm that households in Benin are more likely than households in Togo to plant soybeans, build improved cookstoves and purchase mosquito nets, ceteris paribus. Although we cannot identify the exact mechanism for the large and significant national-level differences in technology adoption, our findings suggest that contextual institutional factors can be more important than household characteristics for technology adoption.",30,2,145-154,Bednets; Benin; cookstoves; governance; institutions; soybeans; technology adoption; Togo; MALARIA PREVENTION; WATER-TREATMENT; SCALING-UP; HOUSEHOLD; IMPLEMENTATION; COOKSTOVES; NETS,

One approach to addressing this problem has been the development of exercise referral schemes (ERSs), in which health professionals refer patients to external exercise providers. These schemes have been widely rolled out across the UK despite concerns that they may not produce sustained changes in levels of physical activity and, therefore, may not be cost-effective interventions. The evidence to determine clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness was evaluated in 2009. This review seeks to update this earlier work by incorporating new evidence and re-examining the cost-effectiveness. Objectives: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ERSs compared with usual care. Design: Exhaustive searches of relevant electronic databases and journals were undertaken to identify new studies evaluating ERSs using a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. RCTs that incorporated a qualitative evaluation of the intervention were identified in order to explore the barriers and facilitators to the uptake of and adherence to ERSs. Data were extracted using a previously designed tool and study quality assessed for potential bias. Where data could be pooled, meta-analyses were carried out. Qualitative analysis was also undertaken using a thematic approach. The cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a Markov structure which estimated the likelihood of becoming physically active and the subsequent risk reduction on coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The model adopts a lifetime horizon, and a NHS and Personal Social Services perspective was taken with discounting at 1.5% for both costs and benefits. Results: The search identified one new RCT and one new qualitative study. The new data were pooled with existing data from the 2011 review by Pavey et al. [Pavey TG, Anokye N, Taylor AH, Trueman P, Moxham T, Fox KR, et al. The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of exercise referral schemes: a systematic review and economic evaluation. Health Technol Assess 2011;15(44)] to give a total of eight studies with 5190 participants. The proportion of individuals achieving 90‚Äì150 minutes of at least moderate-intensity activity per week at 6‚Äì12 months' follow-up was greater for ERSs than usual care (relative risk 1.12; 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.20). Older patients and those referred for CHD risk factors appeared to be more likely than others to increase their levels of physical activity. Qualitativeevidence suggests that interventions enabling the development of social support networks are beneficial in promoting uptake and adherence. Exercise referral gained 0.003 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an additional cost of ¬£225 per person. The estimated mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis was ¬£76, 276. In the univariate sensitivity analysis the results were very sensitive (ICERs ranged from < ¬£30,000 to > ¬£100,000) to changes in the effect of ERSs on physical activity uptake and the duration of the protective effects and the direct health-related quality-of-life gains attributable to physical activity. Conclusions: Exercise referral schemes result in a small improvement in the number of people who increase their levels of physical activity. The cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that the ICER for ERSs compared with usual care is around ¬£76,000 per QALY, although the cost-effectiveness of ERSs is subject to considerable uncertainty.

Objective: This paper provides a brief overview of the role of smartphones in audiologic rehabilitation and hearing research and reports on the findings of a survey assessing attitudes of audiologists towards smartphone integration in hearing healthcare. Design: A total of 258 audiologists working in the United States completed the 10-item survey. Results: The key finding from the survey is that practitioners generally expressed a high willingness to integrate smartphone technology in patient care. Counterintuitively, it was observed that clinicians with the least number of years of experience had relatively more negative attitudes toward smartphone integration in hearing healthcare than clinicians with comparatively more years of experience.

There is a plethora of studies that exist to examine barriers to immunizations including many intervention studies designed to improve immunization rates in children.

In several studies, the SHOTS survey has demonstrated consistent reliability and has been validated in diverse populations. The inclusion of the SHOTS survey instrument in studies to examine barriers to childhood immunization will provide researchers and clinicians with a better understanding of parents' individualized barriers to immunizations. Furthermore, use of the SHOTS survey instrument to collect information about parental barriers to immunizations can lead to targeted interventions to minimize these obstacles at the individual and community level and to help us to achieve our national, state and community childhood immunization goals. ¬© 2016 Taylor & Francis.",12,5,1293-1294,childhood immunizations; instrument; intervention; parental barriers to vaccines; vaccines; child; childhood; doctor patient relation; human; immunization; instrument validation; intervention study; reliability; scientist; attitude to health; child parent relation; male; parent; preventive health service; psychology; questionnaire; reproducibility; statistics and numerical data; Humans; Immunization Programs; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires,

Authorities in countries around the world tend to view charcoal production and use as an environmental and health problem. However, if managed properly charcoal can provide a low-cost and locally available energy source that has the potential to become sustainable and contribute significantly to poverty alleviation. This paper discusses the main obstacles to a sustainable charcoal value chain in sub-Saharan Africa and identifies key areas where interventions are required to improve sustainability while ensuring charcoal continues to provide livelihood benefits. It provides evidence of how a sustainable, transparent and properly regulated and governed charcoal sector could be part of the solution to energy access and economic challenges faced by many developing countries. The paper has been prepared as background to the workshop on 'Sustainable Tree-derived Bioenergy in sub-Saharan Africa'1. While it summarises the most up-to-date literature on the issue at this time, with a strong focus on sub-Saharan Africa, some of the recommendations may be equally applicable to other charcoal-dependent developing countries. Key recommendations * Improve sustainability in the charcoal sector, and reduce associated degradation, through development of and capacity building for community-based forest management options, growing and nurturing trees on farms and in landscapes, strengthening tenure and property rights and improved charcoal production technologies. * Improve governance and financial management and reporting across the charcoal value chain to create a regulated, transparent and coordinated sector which formally contributes to national economies. * Increase participation by disempowered stakeholders in the charcoal sector to encourage greater uptake of more efficient technologies and more sustainable management practices. * Transform the negative image of charcoal, allow sub-national governments to earn charcoal revenues and tap into internationally recognized mechanisms to create incentives for investment in a sustainable charcoal sector.",,196,viii-pp,bioenergy; charcoal; community forestry; energy policy; energy sources; environmental degradation; finance; forest management; forests; fuels; livelihoods; property rights; public health; renewable energy; stakeholders; sustainability; tenure systems,

The fastest power state transition is implemented by a global synchronous clock pause that gates dynamic power consumption without any loss of system state. Extensive use of CMOS circuit topologies, with low static power consumption, provides maximum power savings when the clocks are paused. The memory controller forwards a half bit-rate clock to the memory for synchronous communication, which is similarly paused in the low power state. Thus, dynamic interface power on the memory itself naturally responds to the clock pausing, without any explicit communication from the controller or special low-power state on the memory. Low-swing differential signaling based on a push-pull voltage mode driver results in good signal integrity and power efficiency at peak activity. Test-chips fabricated in a 40 nm low-power CMOS technology achieve 3.3 mW/Gb/s power efficiency at 4.3 GB/s data bandwidth, and support better than 5 mW/Gb/s operation over a range from 0.03 to 4.3 GB/s. ¬© 2010 IEEE.",45,4,889-898,I/O; Low power; Memory interface; Power management; Bit rates; CMOS circuits; CMOS technology; Data bandwidth; Differential signaling; Dynamic interface; Dynamic power consumption; Effective bandwidth; Explicit communication; Low power state; Low static power; Low swing; Low-power memory; Maximum power; Memory controller; Mobile memories; Power efficiency; Power efficient; Power managements; Power state; Rapid transitions; Signal Integrity; Synchronous communications; System state; Voltage mode; Analog to digital conversion; Clocks; CMOS integrated circuits; Electric network topology; Electric power measurement; Embedded systems; Energy management; Signaling; Bandwidth,

Treatment as prevention (TasP) has been proposed as key to ending the HIV epidemic. To activate TasP in high prevalence countries, like South Africa, communities must be motivated to know their status, engage in care, and remain in care. Community mobilization (CM) has the potential to significantly increase uptake testing, linkage to and retention in care by addressing the primary social barriers to engagement with HIV care-including poor understanding of HIV care; fear and stigma associated with infection, clinic attendance and disclosure; lack of social support; and gender norms that deter men from accessing care. Methods/design: Using a cluster randomized trial design, we are implementing a 3-year-theory-based CM intervention and comparing gains in HIV testing, linkage, and retention in care among individuals residing in 8 intervention communities to that of individuals residing in 7 control communities. Eligible communities include 15 villages within a health and demographic surveillance site (HDSS) in rural Mpumalanga, South Africa, that were not exposed to previous CM efforts. CM activities conducted in the 8 intervention villages map onto six mobilization domains that comprise the key components for community mobilization around HIV prevention. To evaluate the intervention, we will link a clinic-based electronic clinical tracking system in all area clinics to the HDSS longitudinal census data, thus creating an open, population-based cohort with over 30,000 18-49-year-old residents. We will estimate the marginal effect of the intervention on individual outcomes using generalized estimating equations. In addition, we will evaluate CM processes by conducting baseline and endline surveys among a random sample of 1200 community residents at each time point to monitor intervention exposure and community level change using validated measures of CM. Discussion: Given the known importance of community social factors with regard to uptake of testing and HIV care, and the lack of rigorously evaluated community-level interventions effective in improving testing uptake, linkage and retention, the proposed study will yield much needed data to understand the potential of CM to improve the prevention and care cascade. Further, our work in developing a CM framework and domain measures will permit validation of a CM conceptual framework and process, which should prove valuable for community programming in Africa.",12,,,Cluster randomized trial; Community mobilization; South Africa; HIV; testing; Engagement in care; Retention in care; Treatment as prevention; GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS; MODELING PROPENSITY SCORES; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; FEMALE SEX WORKERS; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; MISSING-DATA; LONGITUDINAL DATA; MEDICAL-RESEARCH; RECORD LINKAGE; PROJECT ACCEPT,

The goal of this paper is to examine facilitators and barriers to effective implementation that arose among 72 community-based organizations as they moved into practice a multilevel HIV prevention intervention EBI, the Mpowerment Project, for young gay and bisexual men. Methods: CBOs that were implementing the Mpowerment Project participated in this study and were assessed at baseline, and 6-months, 1 year, and 2 years post-baseline. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted separately with individuals at each CBO. Study data came from 647 semi-structured interviews and extensive notes and commentaries from technical assistance providers. Framework Analysis guided the analytic process. Barriers and facilitators to implementation was the overarching thematic framework used across all the cases in our analysis. Results: Thirteen themes emerged regarding factors that influence the successful implementation of the MP. These were organized into three overarching themes: HIV Prevention System Factors, Community Factors, and Intervention Factors. The entire HIV Prevention System, including coordinators, supervisors, executive directors, funders, and national HIV prevention policies, all influenced implementation success. Other Prevention System Factors that affected the effective translation of the EBI into practice include Knowledge About Intervention, Belief in the Efficacy of the Intervention, Desire to Change Existing Prevention Approach, Planning for Intervention Before Implementation, Accountability, Appropriateness of Individuals for Coordinator Positions, Evaluation of Intervention, and Organizational Stability. Community Factors included Geography and Sociopolitical Climate. Intervention Factors included Intervention Characteristics and Adaptation Issues. Conclusions: The entire ecological system in which an EBI occurs affects implementation. It is imperative to focus capacity-building efforts on getting individuals at different levels of the HIV Prevention System into alignment regarding understanding and believing in the program's goals and methods. For a Prevention Support System to be maximally useful, it must address facilitators or barriers to implementation, address the right people, and use modalities to convey information that are acceptable for users of the system. ¬© Kegeles et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",10,1,,"Community level interventions; Community mobilization; Community-based participatory research; Fidelity; Gay men; HIV prevention interventions; Implementation science; Structural interventions; Translating research into practice; Translational science; Young gay men; Young men who have sex with men; bisexuality; capacity building; community care; evidence based medicine; HIV Infections; human; interview; male; male homosexuality; procedures; program development; program evaluation; United States; Community Health Services; Evidence-Based Medicine; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Interviews as Topic",

These services promote economic development among some farmers in the developing world, but not yet in rural Kenya. To understand what factors impede the adoption of these services, we qualitatively studied Kenyan farmers' mobile phone usage patterns and their interactions with MFarm, a commercially available MIS. Using affordance theory to guide our analysis, we discovered a mismatch between the design of MIS and smallholder farmers' perceptions of their mobile phones' communication capabilities. We use these findings to motivate a design agenda that encourages software developers and development practitioners to adopt an ecological perspective when creating mobile applications for sub-Saharan Africa's rural farmers. Strategies for implementing this approach include reconsidering the design of mobile phones, and developing innovative educational interventions. ¬© 2015 Commonwealth Secretariat.",22,2,320-333,affordance theory; agriculture; human‚Äìcomputer interaction; Kenya; market information services; rural,

In the present work in vitro data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods: An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied. Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90%, 86% and 84% for phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were 66%, 62%, and 57%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12 hrs. Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76% at the end of the treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate of the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3) dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160 ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here, albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure. Objectives:Given the extent of bypass graft failure, the motivation behind this multidisciplinary project is to improve the patency of the current bypass grafts by developing a novel and optimised blood flow augmentation technique. Methods: One of the most significant contributions to the improvement of haemodynamics in grafts was based on a research which showed that the 'spiral flow' is a natural phenomenon in the whole arterial system and is induced by the twisting of the left ventricle during contraction and then accentuated upon entering the aortic arch. The benefit of this flow pattern lies in removing unfavourable haemodynamic environment such as turbulence, stagnation and oscillatory shear stress, which are believed to be the main causes of intimal hyperplasia at anastomotic configurations. Results:This multi-disciplinary engineering venture has resulted in a unique product which makes use of both non-planar helicity and an optimised internal ridge within the graft to achieve a significantly improved haemodynamic condition within the anastomosis (an anastomosis is a surgical connection between autologous/prosthetic grafts and veins/arteries inside the human body) Discussion:This truly multidisciplinary project has integrated fluid mechanics, biomechanics and biology with cardiovascular surgery to develop a novel biomedical device, inspired by the nuclear engineering sector. The novel spiral-inducing bypass graft, nominated for this award, is the best example of how engineering techniques, tools and designs can lead to life-saving innovations that could potentially save the lives of thousands of people and save millions of pounds for the healthcare systems across the world. Such successful engineering stories are what would encourage the next generation of engineers to go beyond the traditional boundaries of engineering disciplines to make a difference. Objectives:The goal of this work was to study methods that will allow increase in spatial freedom of couplers orientation in inductive powering unit for implantable medical devices. An inductive energy transfer system is considered, therefore the freedom of relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving coils must be optimized. Methods:The design procedure of inductive powering unit (IPU) consists of two main steps: design of the power amplifier and optimization of an inductive link. To account for the patient specifics, such as tissue thickness near the implantation site, a number of different couplers were simulated using finite element modeling. Effect of coils geometrical parameters on mutual inductance and inductive link efficiency was examined. Class E power amplifier was chosen as a driver for the transmitting coil. Capacitors in the amplifier loading network were tuned to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS). A patient's everyday activity, including walking and even breathing, leads to misalignment of the transmitting and receiving coils, and, as a result, detuning of the amplifier from ZVS and increased losses. Feedback schemes were studied to compensate the misalignments effect on the amplifier. Results:A self-oscillating IPU with class E amplifier was designed that provides stable output power about 0.5 W for the distance between the couplers in range 10-20 mm and the lateral distance up to 20 mm. The use of self-oscillating circuit in the transmitter increases spatial freedom of the transmitting and receiving coils corresponding to ZVS. Discussion: Inductive link geometrical parameters optimization and implementation of self-oscillating class E driver the IPU contributes to stable output power and efficiency of IPU. As a result, less intervention from the patient and physician is required, and patient quality of life is increased Precision medicine emerges from integration of a number of emerging technologies and the data they produce with modern data analytics. For precision diagnostics and for predicting drug responses new computational and in-vitro models are needed from gene regulation to cellular and organ functions. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) derived e.g., from patient blood cells provide means to produce most cell types and thus provide means to get patient specific in-vitro models. New technologies are needed to produce tissues from these cells and to assess the cell functions in-vitro. In addition, computational in-silico models can be used to augment our understanding of the diseases or drug effects. They also provide tools to translate the in-vitro findings to clinical settings and patient populations. We are in transition to turn our in-vitro cell culture models to body-on-chip platforms including environmental control and biophysical functional sensing. We have developed methods to assess the cellular functions based on electrophysiological sensing as well as 2D and 3D bioimaging. For example, we have developed imaging methods to assess functions of hIPSC cardiac cell with simultaneous assessment of electrophysiology such as Calcium and voltage transients as well as mechanobiology in vitro. Further, we have developed in-silico models of various cellular function including multi-cell-type neuronal networks and in-silico population models of the hIPSC cardiomyocytes. The later ones are providing us ionic machinery of hIPSC derived cardiomyocyte electrophysiology in various populations of patiets. We have shown that these computational models can represent pathological patient phenotype cells and populations of patients with specific mutations, e.g., long QT syndrome. We have also demonstrated the power of in-silico as possible pre-screening method for drug effects prior to in-vitro examinations. Moreover, our in-silico results highlight the need of careful consideration of use of HiPSC models before they can be turned from immature cell models to mature tissues in vitro. With integration of novel engineering expertise from multimodal sensing, imaging and computational modelling, we have shown their power on studying diseases and for pre-screening of compounds. Our results demonstrate the power of combined in-vitro and in-silco methods for future precision medicine. Objectives: We have developed in vivo tissue engineered autologous vascular grafts constructed in the subcutaneous of the recipient body. However, since the formation of the vascular grafts depends on the conditions of recipients including high risk or immature patients, immaturity in the fabricated tissues might be problematic for the severely diseased patients because of their suppressed regenerative activity. Therefore, possibility of the xenogeneic or the allogeneic implantation of the grafts should be evaluated. The objective of this study is to fabricate cardiovascular grafts using xenogeneic or allogeneic animals. Methods: Silicone rod molds were placed into subcutaneous pouches of beagle dogs, and after 4 weeks the implants with their surrounded connective tissues were harvested. Those were decellularized with detergents and stored at -20 degrees C for 1 week. Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 2 mm) were xeno-transplanted to abdominal aorta of the rats. Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 5 mm) were cut open and trimmed to elliptical sheets of 15 x 8 mm, they were allo-transplanted to carotid arteries of other beagle dogs as vascular patches. Results: Both xenogeneic vascular grafts and allogeneic patch grafts performed well after transplantation, and the luminal surfaces after resection were very smooth. Histological evaluation also showed host cells infiltration into the grafts. Discussion: Decellularized xenogeneic and allogeneic connective tissue membranes could be ideal vascular grafts. Objectives: This work aimed to print high-resolution, collagen-based, constructs via suspended 3D printing with load-bearing and compositions closer to native bone; for potential use as implant materials. Methods: Collagen type I (Col) and gelatin methacroylate (GelMA) blends were systematically investigated as bio-inks, probing their rheological properties and crosslinking efficiency for printing. An adapted 3D bioprinter (3DDiscovery, regenHU, Switzerland) based on an extrusion principle was used to print constructs. Calcification was investigated, in vitro, using a polymer-induced liquid precursor for the mineralization process. Results: Careful control over the formulation and processing resulted in refined construct properties such as: wall width (500um), lattice length (2cm) and shape (bone trabeculae). Once printed, the ability to cure the GelMA/Col blends was dependent on photo-polymerisation methodology, with enhanced curing and lower remaining soluble fractions (10% vs 40%) for visible light + Riboflavin/SPS in comparison to UV + Irgacure. Control over the construct structure allowed defined mineralisation, and subsequent material responses. Discussion: In recent years the development of 3D printing technologies has attempted to combat the growing need for bone repair solutions, although is limited by the number of bio-inks, and printable resolutions available. Suspended manufacture has sought to address this issue, using a fluid gel to support a secondary biologically relevant bio-ink whilst it undergoes a curing step, during or post-printing. To date, printing techniques have not been shown to provide fully resorbable and/or mechanically satisfactory bone implants. This research has shown promise as the first steps towards printing high resolution constructs with chemical compositions more closely matching that of natural bone. Further works involve deeper investigation of calcification and impact on implants mechanical properties and microstructure. Shifting from treating symptoms to curing chronic diseases by making the transformative promise of Advanced Therapies a reality for the benefit of patients and society and by making Europe a spearhead of Advanced Therapies in Science, Clinics and Biomedical Industry, that is the vision of the large-scale research initiative RESTORE - Health by Advanced Therapies. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and multi-morbidity due to demographic factors represents a high socio-economic burden for Europe. The direct health costs increased by 50% during the last decade and reached euro1.526bn in 2017, a staggering 9.6 % of Europe's GDP. As current therapies rarely cure, but merely fight symptoms, never-ending treatment is required, which means diminished quality-of-life, adverse effects and soaring cost for society. There is a high need to reach sustainable improvement for patients or even to cure them of chronic diseases - in other words, to disrupt the paradigm of ""treating symptoms"" with ""restoring health"". Advanced Therapies are the game changers that open up transforming therapeutic opportunities. For genetic diseases, immune diseases, cancer and tissue injury potential cures through Advanced Therapies exist - it is reality, not fiction. Some products are already on the market, mostly for rare diseases which means only a few thousand patients worldwide have benefitted from Advanced Therapies until now. At the advent of such a trailblazing change, obstacles and roadblocks abound. To make the disruptive promise of Advanced Therapies to cure chronic diseases a reality and to make Advanced Therapies accessible as standard-of-care for every European patient in need, RESTORE envisage to establish a sustainable pan-European ecosystem integrating transdisciplinary research, clinics, patients, and industry. Please join us for more details. RESTORE is funded by the EU for the preparatory phase of the large-scale research initiative (h2020, No 820292). Our main objective is to develop safe medical products for a minimally-invasive surgical intervention that fulfill all requirements by the new Medical Device Regulation (MDR). The secondary objective is to minimize the time to market by implementing standard conforming processes in a minimalistic way so they can be operated by only a handful of people. The twist in the story is that one of our products of our system will be individualized in the operating theater. While basically everybody is forced to operate in a ""learning by doing"" mode regarding MDR compliance, we do rely on external trainings provided by notified bodies and other sources like websites, webinars, and dedicated conferences to learn more about how to fulfil regulatory requirements. Additionally, we are partnering with our strategic investor (a manufacturer of class-III implantable active devices) to receive trainings and advice regarding regulatory affairs. However, it has to be stressed that one has to consider all parts of the MDR, especially the annexes and the applicable norms. Here we present our technical approach and our strategy on how we aim full MDR compliance. We established a completely digital workflow for all our documents, including cryptographic signatures, version history, reviews, mainly based on open source tools. This allows us to handle the document management very swiftly. We have one person dedicated to our quality management system. The risk management is integrated as a cross-cutting-concern into all the product development processes. The main challenge in the planning and founding phase of OtoJig GmbH was and still is to estimate what has to be done, which norms do apply, and how much effort (time and money) it is to perform the steps and create all the required documents. A difficulty is that contradicting statements between the MDR and other applicable norms are still under interpretation and public discussion. Objectives: The aim of this work is to study the influence of person physiology and anatomy, which include postoperative edema, movement and breathing of a patient, on the results of designing of inductive powering unit (IPU) for VAD and to propose design recommendations. Methods: A characteristic feature of the IPU is the misalignment of the coils. The stability of the VAD power supply (especially with continuous powering) is very important. Therefore, it is necessary to design an IPU tolerant to coil misalignment. The procedure of geometrical optimization for increasing the stability of energy transfer of IPU was performed for 3 axial distances between coils d (8, 10, 12 mm), which is a typical misalignment with a postoperative edema. The lateral misalignment of the coils reached the value of the outer radius of the receiving coil (35 mm), which characterizes the patient movement or breathing. The operating frequency was taken 1 MHz, and the output power of the system was 10 W. The power drop was within 10%. The results were verified by numerical simulation in MATLAB and PSpice. Results: It was found that with a decrease of d from 12 to 10 and 8 mm, the optimal outer radius of the transmitting coil increases from 53.9 to 54.6 and 55.7 mm. Turn pitch in the transmitting coil increases from 4.9 to 5.2 and 5.3 mm. For a receiving coil, turns pitch is increasing from 3 to 3.2 and 3.6, respectively. For all cases of d in each coil there are 11 turns (except for d = 8 mm, where there are 10 turns in the receiving coil). It is recommended to design coils with a slightly larger coils turns pitch and the outer radius of the transmitting coil because of disappearance of postoperative edema. Discussion: In this work, the influence of person physiology and anatomy on the design of IPU for VAD was investigated, and recommendations for designing were given. Objectives: Membrane oxygenators are an indispensable part of critical care medicine. Though necessary to supply sufficient gas exchange, the high intrinsic surface introduced by the hollow fiber packing has serious side effects on blood platelet parameters. To reduce these side effects the membrane surface must be minimized and gas exchange improved. Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can support oxygenator optimization and supplement experimental data by delivering a spatial and temporal resolution of the gas exchange. While current research mostly focusses on the gas transport in the blood flow, this work presents a fully resolved CFD approach including transmembrane transport as well as convective and diffusive blood gas transport on shell- and lumen-side of the hollow fibers. Results: CO2 transport in a packing segment of a prototype hollow fiber module was fully resolved and simulated utilizing an inhouse solver membraneFoam based on the open source CFD code OpenFOAM (R). Simulation results show a CO2 partial pressure decline from 50 to 15 mmHg in the laminar boundary layer and an additional drop of 12 mmHg at the selective membrane surface. Boundary conditions for the gas transport simulations were computed by blood flow simulations of the whole module. Simulation results were compared to in vitro tests comprising measurements of CO2 exchange performance and blood side pressure drop of the prototype module. Discussion: Flow simulations predict the experimentally determined pressure drop of 68 mmHg at blood flow rates of 1280 mL/min accurately. The specific CO2 exchange rate of 220 mL STP/min/m2 is overpredicted due to the reduction of the whole packing to an idealized packing segment. Nevertheless, CFD allows for a structured optimization of membrane oxygenators as design changes can be efficiently investigated. Objectives: Anticoagulation therapy in LVAD patients is essential to reduce hemocompatibility related adverse events (HRAE). Phenprocoumon dose must be adapted and monitored by INR point-of-care-testing (POCT) in outpatients. The study aims to determine if the frequency of INR POCT in LVAD outpatients has an influence on the quality of anticoagulation therapy, HRAE and clinical outcomes. Methods: This retrospective, pseudo-randomized study included n=48 patients who received an LVAD implantation (HMII, HM3 and HVAD) between Jan. 2012 and Oct. 2016. Based on the frequency of weekly INR POCT, we compared a daily (n=36) and a 3x/week (n=12) group, specifically the 1-year anticoagulation quality (% of INR Tests in Range) as well as clinical outcomes, readmissions and HRAE using Kaplan-Meier curves. Readmission profiles and outcomes in three groups, based on the achieved quality of anticoagulation (% of INR Tests in Range) ranging from 0-60% (poor), 60-70% (acceptable), 70-100% (well controlled) were compared. Results: Daily and 3x/week groups were similar in demographic and pre-operative risk factors, INR target (2.0-3.0, p=0.27) and Aspirin daily doses (p=0.29). Freedom from any HRAE (38.9% vs. 25.0%, p=0.44), any readmission (72.2% vs. 75.0%, p=0.97) and 1-year survival (91.7% vs. 91.7%, p=0.98) were comparable in both groups. The % of INR Tests in Range was significantly higher with the daily self-assessments (73.5% vs. 68.4%, p=0.006). Freedom from any neurological event (91.7% vs. 75.0%, p=0.14) was n.s. higher in the daily POCT group. Well vs. poorly controlled INR POCT patients had a significant higher freedom from any neurological event (96.0 vs 69.2%, p=0.024) as well as hemorrhagic strokes (100% vs. 76.9%, p=0.011). Discussion: Well controlled anticoagulation of LVAD outpatients results in less neurological events including hemorrhagic stroke. Daily INR POCT and subsequent dose adjustment of vitamin-K antagonists result in a better quality of anticoagulation than 3x/week checks. Objectives: Spectroscopic method is widely used for non-invasive blood glucose (BG) measurement. Despite the progress in implementation of transmission NIR-spectroscopic method, applicable mostly for earlap measurements, research of non-transmission methods allows for the exapnsion of spectroscopy range of use. The aim of research is to estimate the penetration depth for 1600 nm radiation using reflection NIR-spectroscopy. Sufficiency of penetration depth on this wavelength would allow for the use of a mathematical model implemented in the transmission method. Methods: The developed experimental setup includes a semiconductor laser with wavelength of 1600 nm, two photodiodes, reflecting surface, control unit and power supply. For determining the position of optical elements a MATLAB program was developed, which calculated efficient detected radiation intensity depending on distances between the photodiode and the laser and between the laser and reflective surface. Scheme for measuring BG by reflection NIR-spectroscopy partially repeats the scheme used for transmission method. The main differences are in location of photodiodes on the same plane with the radiation source, while their optical axes are co-aligned and parallel to each other, and the reflecting surface tightly abuts the back wall of analytical cell with test solution. Results: The optimal distance between the photodiode and the laser is 5 mm, and between the laser and the reflective surface is 20 mm. This configuration allows intensity of the reflected radiation at about 20% of incident radiation to be obtained. Taking into account the permissible radiation density for skin, this value is enough for skin probing to a depth of 1.5 mm. Discussion: Reflection NIR-spectroscopy is promising method for non-invasive BG measurement. Research of transmission method has shown that the penetration depth of 1.5 mm is enough for receiving information about BG. Thereby mathematical apparatus applied for transmission NIR-spectroscopy can be used and similar error less than 20% can be expected. Objectives: Proper anatomical fitting of implants is crucial for a successful clinical outcome. However, every patient's anatomy is unique and there is a wide variety in the anatomical and morphological characteristics among individuals. Virtual fitting based on imaging data of a high number of patients has crucial benefits compared to conventional approaches during the design process. Methods: Population based engineering is a method that enables a virtual implantation combined with iterative design optimization based on 3D anatomical models created from imaging data of a high cohort of patients. This approach was successfully used during the design process of a novel inflow cannula for a Ventricular Assist Device and a Total Artificial Heart for maximizing the number of treatable patients. The objective was to create a design that contains all components, but which at the same time works for a wide variety of different body types and sizes. Results: The virtual studies have proven to give results that may not have been possible with conventional approaches. Compared with cadaver studies, this approach was a more accurate and economical way for determining the device fit and identifying areas for improvement. Clinical trials and in vivo studies of the devices have shown positive outcomes. Virtual fitting was able to reduce the risk of inflow obstruction, device-vessel misalignment, unexpected variabilities in the patient's anatomy and improper patient selection due to anatomical constraints. Discussion: Population based engineering is a cost-effective solution for including a large number of patients and anatomy variations in the design process. Additionally, this approach can be used for regulatory submission, e.g. to determine and justify anatomical and morphological eligibility or exclusion criteria for proper patient selection and/or the correct implant size. This is especially important in consideration of the future requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) for patient-specific implants. Objectives: None Alcoholic Fatty Liver disorders (NAFLD)is a complex systemic disorder becauseit is associated with clinical states such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes thus involving both liver and pancreas. In particular, pathological pancreas (such as in diabetic patients, in non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disorders patients) led to mis control of insulin secretion (the insulin modulates the lipid accumulation in liver). Methods: Organ on chip approaches is one way to mimic human physiology. In this paper, we will present the development of a liver, pancreas and liver pancreas co-culture model to simulate the interaction between both organs. Results: The morphological analysis confirmed the rat hepatocytes and the rat Langehrans islets were cultivated successfully after the extraction for 7 days. The tissues functionality was confirmed by the production of albumin in the liver on chip models and by the insulin secretion in the pancreas biochips. The RTqPCR analysis confirmed that the pancreas on chip culture contribute to maintain high level mRNA of genes related to glucose insulin homeostasis when compared to Petri control. Then, the GLP1 drug contribute to increase the insulin metabolism in pancreas on chip. In liver pancreas co-culture, we found that the presence of pancreas islet contributed to modify the mRNA levels of glucose-insulin homeostasis related genes in the hepatocytes. It also contributed to increase the insulin production when compared to pancreas biochip control. Discussion: Those results demonstrated the potential of our liver pancreas model to be upgraded to a complex disease model. Objectives: We are developing a novel autologous tissue-engineered heart valve with a unique in-body tissue engineering. This is expected to be a viable bioprosthesis with better biocompatibility. In this study, we developed a conduit-type valve without any foreign materials and tested the feasibility and long-term availability in large animal experiments. Methods: We created plastic molds for Biovalves with a 3D printer easily and quickly considering the recipient character. We embedded them in the subcutaneous spaces of adult goats for about 2 months. After extracting the molds with the tissue en-block and removing the plastic molds only, Biovalves with tri-leaflets similar to those of the native valves were constituted from completely autologous connective tissues and fibroblasts. Total 21 conduit-type Biovalves were implanted in the apico-aortic bypass or the pulmonary artery of goats, (8 and 13, respectively). No anticoagurants were used after implantation. Results: The valves were successfully implanted and showed smooth movement of the leaflets with a little regurgitation in angiogram, and the maximum duration reached to 3 years 7 months. Histological examination of the Biovalves showed the autologous cells covering the laminar surface of the valve leaflets as the endothelium and also migrating into the leaflet body to construct characteristic tissues like native leaflets. Discussion: The valves have a potential to be used for viable bioprosthetic valves and to keep better function and biocompatibility longer than current ones. Objectives: The main purpose of this study is to analyze the correlation between different types of dnDSA and AMR after renal transplantation. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the patients after renal transplantation from January 2002 to March 2017 in our Center. A total of 47 patients with positive PRA and confirmed as dnDSA were included, which were grouped according to the DSA binding to C1q, C3d and subtypes of IgG. Patients were divided into AMR and non-AMR groups according to the pathology of graft biopsy. Results: The pre-transplantation dialysis time of the non-AMR group was longer than that of the AMR group in 47 patients with dnDSA positive (35.4 +33.2 vs 9.8 +10.5, p=0.014). C1q-binding dnDSA had no significant effect on the graft survival after operation and biopsy. Among 47 patients with dnDSA positive, C3d-binding DSA group had lower graft survival time (p=0.009), higher HLA-DP mismatch (0.1 +/- 0.3, p=0.043) and higher percentage of pericapillary C4d deposition (p=0.042), with statistical significance. The graft survival rate of IgG3 subtype negative patients was higher than that of IgG3 subtype positive patients (p=0.003). Cox analysis found that the risk factors for graft survival included IgG3 (OR = 46.877, 95% CI = 4.211-521.830, P = 0.002), HLA-DR mismatch (OR = 0.103, 95% CI = 0.021-0.496, P = 0.005), proteinuriuria at biopsy (OR = 2.097, 95% CI = 1.184-3.713, p=0.024) and creatinine at biopsy (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.001-1.007, P = 1.007) Discussion: Single-center study showed that there was no significant correlation between the incidence of AMR and different types of DSA. The accurate HLA-DR typing should be emphasized during transplantation. The monitoring of specific types of dnDSA will help us to take interventions and thus contribute to the survival of transplanted kidneys. Objectives: Rotary blood pumps (RBPs) are successfully used in high-risk treatments, but clot formation still threatens their long-term application. To reduce the risk of clot formation, in-vitro thrombogenicity testing could help to improve RBP design, as several studies have shown. Those studies were able to simulate in-vitro clot formation in RBPs, but they had limitations regarding a proper quantification of their thrombotic impact. In this study, we assessed if thromboelastometric analyses (TEM) are feasible to quantify the thrombotic impact of RBPs in-vitro. Methods: Five RBPs (n = 5) were placed into simple pump circuits that were built of silicone tubes and reservoirs. Each circuit was filled with 150 ml of slightly heparinized porcine blood (one donor pig per circuit) and the pumps were brought into operation. The pumps operated until a drastic drop in volume flow indicated thrombus formation. We carefully cleaned the RBPs from blood and documented any found thrombus. Prior to this, blood samples were taken at certain time points during pump operation. The blood samples were then analyzed by TEM. Results: TEM measurements showed a decrease in clotting time (CT) over the duration of the test, which indicates an ongoing increase in the activation of the coagulation system caused by the pump. Correspondingly, RBPs revealed visible blood clots at high-risk thrombus formation spots. Discussion: The decrease in CT over time corresponding to clot formation in the RBPs shows that TEM is able to detect and quantify the thrombotic impact of RBPs in-vitro. Thus, TEM could be used in future studies to compare the thrombogenicity of different RBPs by performing comparison tests similar to hemolysis testing. This could lead towards a standardization of",,,,,

However, many barriers to formulating national legislation to address climate change have so far prevented its enactment. The bottom-up approach adopted in the international climate regime sets a good example. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the regional legislation to address climate change in China through exploring the following two questions: whether it is necessary to enact climate change legislation at regional level first and whether it is feasible to develop such regional legislation in the absence of national climate change law. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyses the necessity and feasibility of regional legislation to address climate change. Section 2 introduces the current legislative framework on climate change in China. Section 3 investigates whether it is better to push the legislative agenda at regional, rather than national level. Section 4 analyses the feasibility of establishing regional legislative systems. Section 5 explores the key issues in formulating and promoting regional legislation. Findings: This paper concludes that it is necessary and feasible to pilot regional legislation before enacting national legislation. Under these circumstances, local governments can take the initiative to begin formulating regional legislation. Originality/value: Addressing climate change needs immediate action and effective measures. It is, thus, necessary to reconsider the approach that China should adopt when developing legislation on climate change.

Using a systems approach, this study examined a number of construction innovation system scenarios and policy interventions within the context of four future plausible Russian construction industry transition pathways (i.e. business as usual, market forces, conservative development and innovation power). An integrated participatory systems modelling approach was employed to develop the system dynamics model incorporating the main actors of the construction innovation process, namely, industry, government and university. Construction innovation diffused more rapidly and seeded more innovators than imitators for the innovation power transition pathway, whereby increasing government R&D support was coupled with extensive reductions in barriers. The market forces and state-led conservative development transition pathways showed similar levels of innovation outcomes within the modelling horizon, but predominately yielded innovation imitators. The extensive scenario analysis findings culminated in the formulation of policy recommendations for enhancing innovativeness in the Russian construction industry.",,,,System dynamics; construction innovation; participatory modelling; scenario analysis; transition pathways; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; EXPLOITATION; EXPLORATION; MANAGEMENT; PROJECTS; SECTOR,

Different from centralized strategy, this paper proposes a cooperative energy management scheme based on distributed model predictive control (DMPC) for grid-connected MGC. The normal MGC is virtualized as two-level structure to simplify the internal interactions among subsystems. All the subsystems iterate in parallel adopting the proposed cooperative logarithmic-barrier method, which follows a communication protocol to derive control signals.

The aim is to analyse Serbian energy status taking into account historical factors, to analyse barriers that are hindering transition and to identify leapfrogging potential for the sustainable energy development of the country. Design/methodology/approach: Energy transition and leapfrogging potential have been qualified and quantified by indicators, the own calculations and policy analysis to identify barriers to sustainable energy. Findings: The country has vast potential for leapfrogging in energy transition, yet continues the gradualist approach based on several policy barriers to the process. The analysis shows six barriers related to low energy price, high energy intensity, prioritization of energy security, inadequacy of utilization of renewable sources, lack of policy coherence and dependency on external funding. However, these barriers could be overcome with an energy policy emphasizing leapfrogging potential. As is pointed out in the conclusion, this should be based on the difference between EU-28 average indicators, discrepancy between use and availability of renewable energy, potential for regional cooperation in the energy sector and under-used skills and participation.

Improving sanitation is an essential step towards reducing these deaths. This secondary analysis examined rural Tanzanian households' sanitation behaviors and attitudes in order to identify barriers and drivers to latrine adoption. The analysis was conducted using results from a cross-sectional study of 1000 households in five rural districts of Tanzania. Motivating factors, perceptions, and constraints surrounding open defecation and latrine adoption were assessed using behavioral change theory. Results showed a significant association between use of improved sanitation and satisfaction with current sanitation facility (OR: 5.91; CI: 2.95‚Äì11.85; p = 0.008). Livestock-keeping was strongly associated with practicing open defecation (OR: 0.22; CI 0.063‚Äì0.75; p < 0.001). Of the 93 total households that practiced open defecation, 79 (85%) were dissatisfied with the practice, 62 (67%) had plans to build a latrine and 17 (18%) had started saving for a latrine. Among households that planned to build a latrine, health was the primary reason stated (60%). The inability to pay for upgrading sanitation infrastructure was commonly reported among the households.

A total of 31 in-depth interviews were conducted with primary cooks and their families, health workers, community leaders, and improved stove contractors. Six in-home observations of meal preparation were also conducted. Six major barriers to consistent use of clean stoves were identified: (1) perceived differences in food taste and nutrition by stove type; (2) cooking niches filled by different stoves; (3) social norms related to cooking practices; (4) safety concerns; (5) comparative costs of using different stoves; and (6) lack of awareness and concern about long-term health risks. These findings suggest that to successfully reduce household air pollution, clean cooking programs and policies must consider the many factors influencing adoption beyond health, such as cost, taste, fears, and cultural traditions.

We collected data from focus group discussions with 24 groups of villagers (CHF members and nonmembers) and in-depth interviews with 12 key informants (enrolment officers and health care workers). The transcribed material was analysed thematically. We found that participants highly appreciate the scheme, but to be resolved are the challenges posed by the implementation strategies adopted. The responses of the community were nested within a complex pathway relating to their interaction with the implementation strategies and their ongoing reflections regarding the benefits of the scheme. Community reactions ranged from accepting to rejecting the scheme, demanding the right to receive benefit packages once enrolled, and dropping out of the scheme when it failed to meet their expectations. Reported drivers of the responses included intensity of CHF communication activities, management of enrolment procedures, delivery of benefit packages, critical features of the scheme, and contextual factors (health system and socio-political context). This study highlights that scheme design and implementation strategies that address people's needs, voices, and values can improve uptake of MHI interventions.

The key challenges and opportunities gathered by systematic consultation of senior stakeholders are presented. Coke oven gas and coal gasification are the major short and medium term sources of hydrogen. Underground conversion of coal deposits with integrated carbon capture and storage (CCS) is most important in the long term. Other opportunities include development of renewables, by-product hydrogen and nuclear power. Current lack of infrastructure, particularly for CCS, hydrogen pipelines and clean coal is seen as a significant barrier.

Diversion of waste into biogas and bio-fertilizer will ensure that it is treated in such a way that it becomes a useful product instead of harmful one.

Cross-national data drawn from the African continent were used to examine and account for inter-country variations in the nature and extent of the energy transition process. The empirical analysis reveals that, for the continent as a whole, the extent to which commercial energy replaces traditional fuels is quite low, varying between 33 and 39%. Inter-country variation, however, is quite high, varying from 90% in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and South Africa, to less than 15% in Benin, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Lesotho and Uganda.

This chapter revisits that utopian concept. In the 1970s, the primary concerns regarding energy generation were the potential depletion of global resources and insecurity of supply. Today, climate change is a major driver of interest in green energy generation and distribution, while insecurity of supply appears to remain a significant concern. Cross-border electricity transmission is already a substantial feature of various markets, including those in the European Union, and also takes place between Canada and the United States. And, certainly, governments are interested in regulating this trade to promote the transition to clean energy technologies. The prospects for creation of a global clean electricity grid (GCEG) must address two major elements: first, clean electricity generation, and second, the establishment of a global grid through and across which electricity may be shared. A number of significant studies have looked at the potential for technology transfer to facilitate clean energy generation, including identification of potential patent obstacles. Some of those studies have taken into account the technologies that may be important to the creation of ‚Äòsmart grids' for energy distribution, including identification of intellectual property (IP) issues involving computer software. This author is not aware of any research studies specifically concerning technology transfer issues in connection with the creation of a GCEG. That is, no studies so far appear to have answered the questions of what aspects of technology transfer may be relevant to global cross-border trade in ‚Äògreen' electricity, whether there are potential obstacles to such trade created by the global system designed to protect rights in IP and what might be practical mechanisms for facilitating technology transfer. Defining Transfer of Technology ‚ÄòTransfer of technology' embodies a broad range of activities and actors. The term is sometimes used as shorthand for ‚Äòlow-cost provision of technology from developed to developing countries', but transfer of technology more broadly defined is a ubiquitous feature of international economic activity. Multinational enterprises routinely exchange technology with their affiliates across borders, including through transmissions of data, shipments of materials and equipment, movement of employees, licensing of patents, provision of trade secret information, and so forth. ¬© Cambridge University Press 2017.",,417-427,Cambridge University Press,,

Due to the detrimental impacts of biomass use on human and environmental health, many governments have sought to reduce its use through provision of potentially cleaner energies, of which electricity is the dominant form. Yet there are surprisingly few studies of changes in fuelwood use following the introduction of electricity, especially in rural areas of Africa. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of fuelwood use, using identical approaches, in five rural villages in the Bushbuckridge region of South Africa, spanning the period over which electricity became widely available. Almost a decade after the introduction of electricity, over 90% of households still used fuelwood for thermal purposes, especially cooking, and the mean household consumption rates over the 11-year period had not changed, even with a policy of 6 kWh per month of free electricity. The proportion of households purchasing fuelwood had increased, probably in response to a number of factors, including (i) increased fuelwood scarcity in the local environment as reflected by increased fuelwood collection times, changes in fuelwood species preferences, and ranking of scarcity by local collectors, and (ii) increases in the price of fuelwood well below that of other fuels and the prevailing inflation rate. Overall, there was an increase in the number of species harvested over the 11-year period.

The genetic algorithm-based analytic hierarchy process is employed to form energy transition strategies in the cities of Guiyang, Tongren, Zhangjiakou, and Nanning. The priority values of different renewable energy technologies are given for the cities. The results show that resource endowment is not the only driver for the priority due to the unique combination of influence factors in decision. The assessment system can help avoid the problems of single operating mode and over-investment in the process of energy transition so as to find the benchmark for energy structure adjustment.

Such a transition has considerable spatial-physical and socioeconomic implications, suggesting area-based perspectives and related decentralized governance approaches as being crucial to complement, or partly replace, traditional centralized governance approaches. In response to implementation barriers to energy policies, China has also begun to experiment with more decentralized governance structures through the launch of national pilot programs. In the meantime, international studies have disputed the widely assumed benefits of decentralized approaches. Scholars have especially cautioned that decentralization needs to be informed about the degree to which local stakeholders are willing and able to cope with newly acquired responsibilities or tasks. This research investigates the willingness and ability of Chinese local authorities to perform tasks indicated in the pilot program ‚ÄòNew Energy Demonstration City (NEDC)'. This research, involving four case study cities and over 20 expert interviews, noted only modest willingness and ability. Local performance is constrained by inadequate local technical and managerial ability and a possible weak profile of renewable energy compared to other local priorities, and a limited local scope of influence over energy transition-related challenges as well decreased local willingness and ability. This research concludes that decentralization under energy policies should take place within a context of central support and stimuli, highlighting the importance of national policies and regulations to enable and activate local authorities and stakeholders in pursuing energy transition policies. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",189,,830-838,China; Energy transition; Governance experimentation; New energy demonstration city program; Demonstrations; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Decentralized approach; Energy transitions; Governance structures; Implementation barriers; New energies; Sustainable energy systems; Public policy,

Understanding the driving forces of CO 2 emissions from power generation is critical for both decarbonizing the power sector and achieving national carbon reduction targets. The objectives of this study were to identify critical driving forces behind changes in CO 2 emissions from the power sector and to propose appropriate decarbonization pathways. First, the generation and demand structures of the power sector were introduced into a CO 2 emission accounting model and decomposition analysis. Instead of traditional input‚Äìoutput analysis, structural decomposition analysis modified using a power transmission table was used to investigate the impacts of five driving factors of CO 2 emissions from China's power generation. The five driving factors comprised the proportion of thermal power, power generation technology, power generation structure, power demand structure and power demand, whereby the latter was divided further into nine detailed parts. Considering five regional power grids in China, the contributions of these factors were analyzed at both national and regional level. The results showed that the majority of the increase in CO 2 emissions during 2007‚Äì2012 could be attributed to electricity generation (96.2%) driven by changes in power demand, which should be the key to power sector decarbonization. By contrast, 30.7% of emissions were offset by changes in the proportion of thermal power and technology, demonstrating the obvious effects of China's policy on clean energy transition. Additionally, all power grids exhibited an increase in CO 2 emissions from electricity generation, with the east and central grids accounting for 64% of the national increase. Power transmission structure had only a small impact on CO 2 emissions from power generation. By using the electricity transmission table, we modified SDA to overcome the time lag issues and eliminate the reliance on IO data, and continuous annual data rather than aggregated five-yearly data can be used to capture the structural effects, thus providing more precise results for the driving forces of emission changes. Our case study shows that there is huge potential in extending the IO-based SDA method to other trade-related studies. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",220,,1143-1155,CO 2 emission; Decomposition analysis; Power sector; Power transmission; Carbon dioxide; Decarbonization; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission; Electric power utilization; Fuels; Structural analysis; CO2 emissions; CO2 emissions from fuel combustion; Critical driving force; Electricity transmission; Power generation technology; Structural decomposition analysis; Electric power transmission networks,

Recent developments in technology are helping change the current centralized paradigm into one of integrated distributed clean energy resources. In spite of these developments, radical transformation is not occurring at a speed to effectively meet environmental targets, mostly due to the incumbent carbon lock-in trajectory. We argue that business model (BM) innovation dynamics are key drivers in accelerating the low carbon power system transition, often operating irrespective of the underlying technology. We combine BM theory with the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical transitions to present a useful framework to analyze this potential transition. This paper presents the application of this framework characterizing relevant BM dynamics of niche and regime business actors, and supporting these with illustrative examples. Particularly, we find that new actors in the distributed energy business are achieving market scale by offering financially innovative BMs that do not require upfront costs from customers. Higher penetrations of renewable energy sources in liberalized electricity markets are destabilizing the historical BM of large centralized utilities through erosion of wholesale prices. Furthermore, a shift towards distributed and dynamic energy resources further challenges incumbents and might bring opportunities for BMs focused on active customer participation and social value creation. As these tendencies are expected to accelerate, we find analyses of BMs will have important relevance for future power system transition research. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",126,,572-585,Business models; Disruptive innovations; Electricity system transition; Low carbon transition theory; Multi-level perspective; Commerce; Electric power systems; Energy resources; Renewable energy resources; Electricity system; Low-carbon transitions; Multilevels; Climate change,

The local scale allows the development and implementation of site specific strategies to address climate change in urban areas that have been proven to be more efficient, especially within buildings. But these must be within the wider context of transport and other energy consumption. A unique integrated assessment methodology for the analysis of energy at the neighbourhood scale that considers the key sectors of buildings, transport and outdoor lighting has been developed. The influence of key drivers of energy consumption: land use, technology, infrastructure design, are considered to assess how neighbourhood choices impact upon wider energy usage, such as transport emissions. Applied to a neighbourhood in Italy, results show that building retrofit has the greatest benefit, of up to 60%. However, by transitioning to a mixed land use neighbourhood, growing local employment and improving the transit network, reductions of 80% can be achieved in line with the requirements of the Paris Agreement. The method highlights the importance of taking a multi-sector and multi-scale approach to considering neighbourhood mitigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Many and diverse actors with contrasting interests interact in urban sustainability transitions. Their perceptions and values impact the potential uptake of transition strategies in urban systems. It is thus important to understand how actors view themselves involved in such processes. A case study on low carbon transitions for the city of Bilbao (Basque Country) is presented to explore the barriers and opportunities for an energy transition using Q methodology. Results suggest that stakeholders' motivation and perceived capacity for change are mainly related to four main discourses: follower, visionary, pragmatist and sceptic. Results also indicate that information exchange, communication and participation in decision-making processes, bridging visionaries and pragmatists with decision-makers, are key for bringing about effective transition processes. This study contributes to identifying attitudes of actors who can negotiate urban low-carbon transitions and stresses the need to build a common shared cognitive vision of whether and how sustainable urban transformation can take place. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

With a view to promoting sustainable regional development this inquiry investigates whether a reframing of bioenergy supply chain design can allow sustainable regional development targets to feature as integral supply chain components and both help upgrade existing bioenergy processes and initiate new bioenergy value chains. Following a critical survey of classic supply chain management we use a Total Quality Management approach to operationalize the concept of regional energy and pilot the development of sustainable bioenergy pathways within North European regional settings. We argue that a methodical enhancement of supply chain design can help overcome the challenges facing bioenergy and at the same time provide a blueprint for pioneering feasible regional energy initiatives as alternatives to conventional energy processes.

China has achieved 100% electricity access, while the traditional solid fuels such as firewood are still widely used in its rural area. This paper, using a long-term and large micro dataset and multinomial logit model, investigates quantitatively the determinants of cooking fuel choice in rural China. The results show that in addition to the previous knowledge on household income, occupation is crucial to the cooking fuel transition. In average, if the head of household changes its occupation from farm to non-farm, the possibility of using firewood would reduce by around 14‚Äì21%. The impact of income is slightly small. A 10% increase in income may result in 0.5% of possibility of firewood use. These conclusions are robust after considering the possible energy ladders using ordered logit regressions (OLR) and generalized OLR. After controlling other factors such as income and occupation, we have not found concrete evidence on the influences of education and gender of the household head and household member numbers. To accelerate the fuel transition, in addition to increase the household income, the government should pay attention to create more non-farm work opportunities for the rural.",225,,104-111,Cooking fuel choice; Energy transition; Multinomial logit; Rural China,

Energy system models can usefully analyze future residential sector energy pathways ‚Äúwithin‚Äù the full energy system. However, few energy system models have been developed with disaggregated sub-national regional detail, building type and urban/rural divisions. This paper addresses this key gap. Disaggregating the residential sector by building categories allows improved representation of the range of energy transition options across building categories. We incorporated a novel detailed building stock module into a 16-region TIMES energy systems model for Kazakhstan, using statistical data on the housing stock and building energy audit reports. We then explore the introduction of a coal ban and use scenario analysis to identify the most cost-effective heating technologies for the different regions and different building types. Implications of the residential sector policies to the supply side energy infrastructure were also quantified. The energy transition (from solid fuels to cleaner alternatives) is rarely achievable without Government intervention, therefore scenarios with ban on coal use and clean energy technology subsidies (micro-CHP, heat pumps and solar space heaters) have been investigated in this study. The results indicate that in rural areas networked gas (for detached households) and district heating (for flats) are more economically viable substitutes to coal, even with subsidies offered for clean technologies. In the scenario with the constraint on gas network expansion and clean technology subsidies, there is a wide utilization of heat pumps in detached rural houses. Subsidies for retrofit measures are effective with wide utilization, especially in the areas affected by the coal ban, with up to 76% reduction of the useful energy demand. The total amount of allocated subsidies for clean technologies amounted for up to 32% and 8% of the current state social and health care expenditures. A coal ban in the residential sector is estimated to achieve emissions reductions for PM2.5 and CO of 92% and 95%, respectively (compared to the base year level), even accounting for emissions from the supply side (power plants, heat plants).",196,,1532-1548,Housing stock; Heat; Energy system model; Coal; Kazakhstan,

This paper adds to existing scientific knowledge through a clear focus on private sector perceptions. Through the analysis of previous public statements from organisations and coalitions in the finance sector a number of investment barriers were identified. These initial barriers fed into a Delphi process. The outputs of the Delphi process were categorized into five sets of barriers and a number of policy solutions associated with investing into clean energy solutions.

Deaths result mainly in women, children and infants, who are directly exposed to smoke in unventilated kitchens, thus reflecting differentiated and unequal impacts across population groups. Despite the heavy health burden and discomfort, IAP has only recently been recognised as associated with neglected diseases. In search of synergies between adaptation and mitigation, we seek gender sensitive social innovations to halt smoke, soot and early death while reducing deforestation and carbon emissions. Using transition arenas as a participatory method for experiments and social learning we engaged with local entrepreneurs and peasant farmers in sub- Saharan Africa to initiate co-production of efficient flue-piped stoves that save energy, labour and lives. Findings indicate that successful design, production and adoption of improved cooking stoves is possible, but the structural challenges of poverty, inequality and distrust may inhibit further diffusion and more profound processes of social learning. Insights from local studies must therefore be contextualised into broader understandings, as attempted here, while local adoption must be combined with wider initiatives and government policies into complex micro-to-macro solutions that provide forceful effects against IAP and its drivers. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

But, the economics of biomass based power projects depends on the long term and secure supplies of sustainable feedstock. In case of agricultural residues, the feasibility of installation of a power plant is directly dependent on the transport cost and their availability in a region. Therefore, region-wise planning and policies are required to promote their utilization for energy purpose. The present paper summarizes the methodology to evaluate the state-wise power potential of agricultural residues in India. Further, other issues related with their utilization for electricity generation have also been discussed. It has been revealed that biomass power potential is highest in the state of Uttar Pradesh (6045 MW) followed by Punjab (3585 MW), Maharashtra (3139 MW) and Haryana (2300 MW), while its value varies significantly within the country. But, these resources are not exploited to a considerable extent by various states due to a number of challenges. The logistics of biomass collection and the moisture contents are the major barriers in this regard. But, selection of appropriate technology (combustion or gasification) and favorable policies (for use of biomass for energy) can help to resolve these issues. Various government incentives (at state and central level) such as schemes, grants and subsidies have encouraged the adoption of the grid connected biomass combustion/cogeneration projects (at megawatt scale) and the off-grid gasification units (small scale plants) for rural electrification. The study reveals that the future targets for the biomass based installed capacity can be achieved by successful implementation of these schemes in the country.",142,Part 4,3985-4000,biomass; combustion; electricity generation; feasibility studies; gasification; moisture content; policy; renewable energy,

The results reveal that a great number of factors were found to have positive effect on solar energy technology adoption. The findings of this paper establish that wealthy and more educated households are more likely to adopt solar energy technology compared to poorer ones. Male-headed households are less likely to adopt solar energy technology compared to female-headed counterparts. The main implication of this study is that there is a scope for poverty reduction policies and adult education that targets household heads and spouses to promote adoption of solar energy technology. Therefore, policymakers could target appropriate measures in order to improve household wealth, education, and awareness. In this way, there is a much higher chance for them to successfully promote solar energy use by rural households.",204,,193-204,Solar energy; Technology adoption; Determinants; Rural; Households; Ethiopia,

At the Paris climate agreement in 2015, major cities were identified as a key player to decarbonise the energy generation sector. Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, within which the local government sector has a significant capacity to accelerate a transition to clean energy generation. Through a case study of a renewable energy master plan involving five urban-councils in Sydney, this study uncovers the underlying drivers and emerging project challenges behind a cooperative joint-council approach. Social and environmental responsibility was found to be the primary motivator to develop a regional renewable energy master plan. Leveraging the collective bargaining-power through a regional joint-procurement process was an equally significant motivation. The study also revealed five major challenges. Most projects are reliant on some degree of funding from commonwealth and state government grants which are often associated with political uncertainty and a lack of continuity in programs and funding. Different positions exist as to the preferred financing options for solar-systems among councils. The previous success of a collective bargaining by councils that secured below-market prices supply-contracts of fossil-based electricity, paradoxically, reduced the financial viability of the current renewable energy project. The installable roof-space of some sites was over-estimated when not considering an on-site demand and low feed-in-tariff dynamics. Insolvency risk of renewable energy suppliers was identified as a factor that could impact on the long-term success of the project. Looking forward there are opportunities for progressing clean energy generation transformation through collective action by local government. Revolving clean energy funds can be used to establish and support renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Regional collaboration can draw on existing technical expertise and institutional and political learnings. Power supply arrangements between councils should be supported through innovative governance and financial arrangements. Combined, these initiatives should be framed to distribute risks, lessen uncertainty and support innovation. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",220,,655-667,Climate and energy policy; Energy transition; Local governments and cities; Renewable energy; Renewable investment; Electric power systems; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Industrial relations; Motivation; Regional planning; Clean energy generation; Energy transitions; Local government; Regional collaboration; Renewable energies; Renewable energy projects; Social and environmental; Urban energy systems; Investments,

In response to this call, this paper addresses the role of actors and, particularly, organisations in transitions. It examines the role of organisational change in socio-technical sustainability transitions and, more specifically, how transition initiatives may trigger and support these changes in organisations and systems. For this purpose, the paper draws on literature from both transition studies and organisational change management (OCM) to build a multi-scale, integrative theoretical heuristic. This addresses drivers and barriers for organisational change as an integral part of transition processes, connecting the micro level of the individual, the meso level of the organisation and the macro level of the broader system in which the organisation is located. With the goal of illustrating the links between OCM and transition studies, this paper empirically examines the impact of Region 2050, a large, multi-organisation transition initiative in Sweden, in terms of creating change within the organisations involved. The main focus is on how the organisations acquire the new knowledge and capabilities required for improving regional planning for sustainability. The empirical study identifies leverage points at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels, which may be used in order to change strategic planning processes. Three different theoretical concepts from transition studies and OCM that could help to foster long-term planning are also identified: (1) the macro-level of institutional plurality and its connection to the meso- (organisational) level; (2) collaboration as a key success factor on the organisational level; and (3) at the micro-level, the roles of individuals as change agents and boundary spanners. Overall, the case highlights the merits of the OCM literature for transition studies and their emphasis on understanding interacting processes operating at multiple scales. ¬© 2019 The Authors",232,,359-368,Change management; Organisations; Sustainability transitions; Transition initiatives; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Organisational change; Organisational level; Socio-technical transitions; Strategic planning process; Sustainability transition; Strategic planning,

To examine the literature related to a large-scale quality improvement initiative, the 'Productive Ward: Releasing Time to Care', providing a bibliometric profile that tracks the level of interest and scale of roll-out and adoption, discussing the implications for sustainability. Background. Productive Ward: Releasing Time to Care (aka Productive Ward) is probably one of the most ambitious quality improvement efforts engaged by the UK-NHS. Politically and financially supported, its main driver was the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement. The NHS institute closed in early 2013 leaving a void of resources, knowledge and expertise. UK roll-out of the initiative is well established and has arguably peaked. International interest in the initiative however continues to develop. Methods. A comprehensive literature review was undertaken to identify the literature related to the Productive Ward and its implementation (January 2006-June 2013). A bibliometric analysis examined/reviewed the trends and identified/measured interest, spread and uptake. Results. Overall distribution patterns identify a declining trend of interest, with reduced numbers of grey literature and evaluation publications. However, detailed examination of the data shows no reduction in peer-reviewed outputs. There is some evidence that international uptake of the initiative continues to generate publications and create interest. Conclusions. Sustaining this initiative in the UK will require re-energising, a new focus and financing. The transition period created by the closure of its creator may well contribute to further reduced levels of interest and publication outputs in the UK. However, international implementation, evaluation and associated publications could serve to attract professional/academic interest in this well-established, positively reported, quality improvement initiative. Relevance to clinical practice. This paper provides nurses and ward teams involved in quality improvement programmes with a detailed, current-state, examination and analysis of the Productive Ward literature, highlighting the bibliometric patterns of this large-scale, international, quality improvement programme. It serves to disseminate updated publication information to those in clinical practice who are involved in Productive Ward or a similar quality improvement initiative.",23,17-18,2414-2423,health service research; implementation; lean healthcare; multidisciplinary care team; Productive Ward; quality improvement; Releasing Time to Care; HEALTH-CARE; IMPLEMENTATION,

A literature search was completed to find articles related to consumer engagement in the use of health information technology. The literature found was then categorized based on a patient engagement framework defined by the National eHealth Collaborative. The barriers to engagement, issues with types of technology, and problems in study methodology were then synthesized for understanding consumer engagement. The results of the review showed the major barriers related to engaging consumers in the use of health information technology, including privacy, education, cost, literacy, accuracy of information, trust, meeting consumer needs, measures, integration, and policy. The most prevalent of these issues is that health information technology is often not designed with accurate and detailed user requirements in mind. Issues of the methodologies used to show how consumer health information technology is consumed relate to studies that are not aligned with the original purpose of the experiment. Additional work and research is needed to ensure that the design of consumer health information technology meets the consumer's needs. Improved designs and methods of achieving these designs will create technology that consumers find appealing to use in order to better manage their health. If consumers find value in the technology, they will be more likely to engage and adopt it for additional use. ¬© 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC ¬© 2017 Sandra Long, Karen Monsen, David Pieczkiewicz, Julian Wolfson, and Saif Khairat.",21,4,369-388,Consumer health information; consumers; health care; review article; technology; adult; education; female; health status; human; information technology; literacy; male; privacy; telehealth; trust,

The review focused on social science literature pertaining to alternative forms of household water, with an emphasis on research examining decentralised water acceptance. Researchers consistently reported that most communities were open to alternative water sources for domestic applications; however, this was highly dependent upon the level of personal contact with the water. Acceptance and adoption of alternative water technology, such as decentralised systems, was influenced by risk perception, water culture, and threat perception. Motivational drivers were also identified as potentially influencing adoption of decentralised systems. A clear limitation of the literature was found to be an over-reliance on measuring people's intentions to adopt alternative water systems and building a conceptual understanding of acceptance solely on hypothetical water supply scenarios. Further, within the social science literature there appears to be a skewing towards focusing on acceptance of centralised alternative water, such as recycled and desalinated water systems. Although there are some research outcomes that are generalisable to the decentralised water context, it is clear that there is a significant gap in the knowledge base of social drivers specific to the acceptance of decentralised water systems and the factors contributing to its widespread use. It is recommended that future research focus on examining public attitudes relevant to decentralised water systems, as well as adoption behaviours among current users of these systems. This will assist in developing policies specific to domestic decentralised water use. ¬© 2010.",92,3,380-391,Acceptance; Adoption; Australia; Decentralised systems; Recycled water; ground water; surface water; decentralization; desalination; household survey; risk perception; socioeconomic impact; water planning; water supply; community dynamics; household; human; motivation; review; risk assessment; scientific literature; socioeconomics; sociology; threat; urban area; waste water recycling; Family Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors,

We find that attributes of the existing and the new technology, beyond the price, are relevant determinant factors of the participation decision and payment. Limited access to credit markets for low income families can be a major barrier for an effective implementation of these types of programs. Variations in the design of the subsidy and on the regulator's objective and constraints can have significant impact on the level and the cost of reduction of aggregate emissions achieved.

This paper examines how different ideological and political frameworks shaped the development of renewable technologies in the USA since the energy crises of the 1970s. Public discourse about renewable energy embodied conflicting ideas about how to manage natural resources and different plans for distributing political power in society. Questions about the appropriate role of government in shaping energy futures also influenced the politics of renewable technologies. Illuminating the hidden ideological and political dynamics that surrounded energy policy in this formative era helps us to see the barriers involved in our current energy transition as part of a broader historical continuum.

A.",The state of natural gas,Journal of Natural Gas Science and Engineering,18755100 (ISSN),10.1016/j.jngse.2009.03.005,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S187551000900002X?via%3Dihub,"As global energy demand rises, natural gas now plays an important strategic role in energy supply. It is more difficult to transport and store gas than oil and consequently it lagged behind that commodity for a considerable period. Over the last couple of decades this has changed and gas markets continue to expand more rapidly than those of other fossil fuels. Natural gas is the cleanest and most hydrogen-rich of all the hydrocarbon energy sources and it has high energy conversion efficiencies for power generation. Of more significance is that gas resources discovered but as yet unexploited remain plentiful. The sector is poised for considerable growth over the next two decades and some believe that it may even overtake oil as the prime fuel between 2020 and 2030. The trend towards natural gas becoming the premium fuel of the world economy is not now easily reversible. The key and the challenge for the energy industry is how that transition is to be managed. We examine in this paper sources of natural gas, their limitations and potential. We also identify the technological and commercial challenges to be overcome in taking the world through the transition. There is a fundamental turn towards natural gas which today accounts for about 23% of the world energy demand. Large capital investments in infrastructure to enable increased gas consumption are being made on both demand and supply sides. Several gas-producing countries have embarked upon very ambitious plans for markedly increased gas output. Many new LNG facilities are being built supply chains diversifying and becoming ever more flexible. There is a growing recognition that unconventional sources of gas, such as shale gas, coal bed methane (CBM) and deep tight gas will contribute a significant component of future gas supplies as technologies evolve. Other gas conversion technologies such as GTL and CNG are attracting more serious attention, but energy efficiency, cost and cost inflation remain barriers for these promising alternatives. Natural gas is also competing strongly with other fossil fuels from an efficiency and emissions perspective as the fuel of choice for power generation. However, gas price volatility and security of supply concerns means that some power generators still favor coal and nuclear components in their power generation portfolio. As the cost of carbon emissions have a bigger impact around the world, gas has the potential to increase its share of the power generation market significantly over the coming decade. A rapid growth opportunity exists for natural gas in its potential contribution to transportation either directly or by electrifying the sector. Real and imagined environmental concerns and restricted access for OECD nations to long-term oil reserves are expected to accelerate the emergence of hydrogen fuel cells. Currently available technologies dictate that the most commercially viable source of hydrogen in large quantities is natural gas, particularly methane through the reforming processes that yield synthesis gas (i.e. carbon monoxide and hydrogen). Current technologies, investments and consumption trends suggest that natural gas will be at the center of a worldwide transformation resulting in a greatly expanded market share of gas in the energy mix for power generation, space heating, petrochemical feedstocks and transportation fuels (e.g. natural gas vehicles are now on the agenda for both energy efficiency and lower emissions reasons). ¬© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The proposition is to find out the possibility of grid-connectivity of isolated remote islands which is under rural electrification scheme by hybrid renewable energies under Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission of India. In these rural electrification program, grid extension can be the best option if the grid is reliable, the rural community rather big and in proximity to the grid. In many circumstances, a strong case for mini-grids based on hybrid systems can be made. Scattered communities and isolated houses are well served by solar and small hydro (where available) or small wind energy systems. By feeding renewable electricity to the utility grid through grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system, during time of peak demand, sufficient electrical loads can be shed to prevent turning on a coal or natural gas-fired plant and therefore save CO2 emissions and potentially energy import costs, replacing fossil fuels. But there is a barrier for grid-connectivity for isolated island, which can be overcome by feed-in-tariff policy implementation for renewables. Also, feed-in-tariff for mini-grids is a promising approach for linking off-grid and grid-connected renewable energy support. Also, most intelligent controller for grid interactive operation of solar photovoltaic-wind-bio hybrid energy system at Moushuni Island is proposed. This intelligent controller will switch from various renewable resources like solar-wind-biomass through change over switch panel to find out optimized hybrid renewable energy system. Malda district of West Bengal, India is a vision towards smart-grid city towards sustainable future, where rural consumers can upgrade their quality of life through solar energy resource. This paper also illustrated the socio-economic and environmental benefits and social costing of adopting renewables future for India. Cost proposition for integrating distributed renewable energy sources-solar energy to electricity grid has been analyzed along with the feasibility studies for factors responsible for cost/unit reduction. The feasibility studies for social, economic, and environmental benefits of renewables have been discussed along with justifications for hybrid renewable vs stand alone-photovoltaic and other types of renewable energy systems along with the comparative analysis of economic costing of installation of various types of renewable energy systems.

In this paper, we illustrate how scientific research can be mobilized within professionally facilitated change management workshops to engage a broad range of stakeholders and co-create knowledge in a rural development context. Multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary and multi-national stakeholders have contributed to finding innovative solutions to challenges experienced by smallholder farmers. By combining different worldviews we were able to assess research priorities, define problems and determine research options based on new hybrid knowledge systems. The outcome of this transdisciplinary process was the co-creation of a Research Discussion Tool and identification of 9 thematic areas which, in combination, enabled obstacles to technology uptake to be overcome and for smallholder farmers to benefit from research-based innovations. The process involved assisting Lao national researchers and extension agents to co-develop solutions, strategies and methods to improve technology uptake by farmers in the lowlands of southern Lao PDR using a series of change management interventions. A complex ecology of factors involving farmers' decision drivers/motivations and farmers' decision enablers within farmers' production systems influence technology uptake. The relative importance of each factor is dependent on the specific technology that is being introduced. Hence, projects that introduce new technologies struggle to address all relevant factors and often do not have the ability to deal with the complex array of factors that are at play. The process of co-construction embeds local knowledge that becomes accessible to projects. The approach we document in this paper also has the potential to harness collaborative exchanges with other projects in similar geographical regions. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",72,,216-227,Adoption; Agriculture; Innovation; International development; Knowledge; Rural development; Technology; agricultural research; agricultural technology; farmers knowledge; smallholder; technology adoption; Laos,

In sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of urban dwellers live in informal settlements served by inadequate sanitation facilities. These settlements present unique challenges to the provision of sustainable and hygienic sanitation, and there is insufficient information on access to improved facilities. This paper reports findings of a study undertaken in low-income informal settlements using a mixed methods approach to assess access to sanitation and identify the barriers to household uptake of improved sanitation facilities. More than half of the respondents (59.7%) reported using sanitation facilities that are included in the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme definition of improved sanitation. However, a high proportion of these facilities did not provide access to basic sanitation. Less than 5% of all the respondents did not report problems related to sustainable access to basic sanitation. The findings highlight the urgent need to develop specific and strategic interventions for each low-income informal settlement, to upscale the sustainable access and use of improved sanitation in urban centres. ¬© IWA Publishing 2015",5,1,89-99,Access; Barriers; East Africa; Improved sanitation; Informal settlements; Mixed methods,

Study findings show that only 8.5% of households were using improved sanitation facilities with more than 75% of the households relying on open defecation and communal trench latrines. Knowledge of technological options was very limited and the cost for preferred latrines was unaffordable. Though health-related benefits motivated household latrine uptake, those related to personal security, privacy, social status and convenience were ranked higher. sanitation uptake was constrained mainly by finances, poor sanitation promotion and general biophysical factors. High costs of latrine construction could be reduced by introducing cheaper technological options, using low-cost construction materials and labor contributions from households. Financing models like microcredit financing can also be explored and adapted for use in Ghana. We recommend the use of approaches aimed at behavior change while giving households a range of technological options such as community led total sanitation (CLTS).

Among temperate and Mediterranean European countries that have seen an expansion of forest cover, Portugal stands out as the only case in which this trend has recently been reverted. In this study, we explicitly map and document the forest transition (FT) in the country over the period 1907-2006, and investigate when and where forest transition happened de facto, and which were the land use transition pathways that resulted from the shrublands, agriculture, and forest interplay dynamics. After thematic and geometric harmonization of land cover maps from 1907, 1955, 1970, 1990, and 2006, a cluster analysis established four typologies, and a transition matrix was constructed to assess land cover dynamics. We found that up to 1955, FT occurred simultaneously with agricultural expansion, as shrubland areas diminished. Afterwards, with the retraction of agricultural area and the consequential decoupling of forest management from local actors, FT gained momentum and expanded up to the 1990s. While during the first half of the 20th century, forest expansion followed the ""Scarcity"" and ""State Policy"" pathways fostered by local socio-ecological feedback loops, throughout the second half of the century forest transition was driven by exogenous socio-economic forces, following ""Economic Development"" and ""Globalization"" pathways. We show how, despite these forces, FT can be derailed by endogenous factors such as wildfires, which limited and in some areas even reverted the afforestation process, initiating a deforestation phase. Since the necessary conditions for FT (technology shift, urbanization, agriculture retraction and public afforestation programs) were available in mainland Portugal, we advance the hypothesis that critical wildfire risk governance deficits may have been responsible for arresting FT. Considering the critical role of forests and other wooded areas in supporting climate change mitigation and sustainable development, our work provides useful evidence and insights for public decision makers on previously unaddressed dimensions of FTT.",66,,214-226,Forest transition; Land cover change; Cluster analysis; Wildfire policy; Risk governance; LAND-COVER CHANGE; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; AGRICULTURAL LAND; LANDSCAPE; CHANGES; FIRE REGIME; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS; VALIDATION; DRIVERS; AREAS,

Policy and advisory communities have championed PATs as a route to preserving natural capital whilst increasing productivity from agricultural land. A range of PATs are currently available for the agricultural producer but uptake varies by the type of technology and region. Whereas most studies on uptake have focused on US or Australia we empirically examine uptake of machine guidance (MG) and variable rate nitrogen technologies (VRNT) within European farming systems. Using primary information from 971 arable crop growers across five countries: Belgium, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands and the UK, a multilevel random intercept regression estimated a) the differences between adoption and non-adoption and b) the differences between VRNT and MG adoption. We find, aside from size and income differences, which reflect the economic cost barrier to adoption, an attitudinal difference, in terms of optimism towards the technology's economic return leading to more probability of uptake.

Over the past decade, several regions with low population density have successfully transited towards renewable energy (for example Siena, Italy). In the Netherlands and other countries, more densely populated regions have drawn up ambitious targets for energy transition. Most of these transition targets lack empirical evidence with regard to spatio-technological feasibility. This lack of evidence may compromise energy transition if constraints are discovered posteriori and short-term milestones missed. To address this shortcoming, we propose an integrated approach. Spatial Transition Analysis (STA) can assist in defining spatially explicit and evidence-based targets for energy transition. STA combines quantitative modelling of energy potentials, qualitative spatial considerations for the siting of renewable energy technologies and comparative scenario development. The application of STA in a case-study (Parkstad Limburg, the Netherlands) revealed that the region has the potential to become energy neutral between 2035 and 2045. Examining and illustrating the different types of constraints as well as the possible choices between renewable energy technologies enabled stakeholders to start planning for energy transition and implementing first interventions. This shows that STA provides a solid framework to foster sustainable energy transition initiated by regional stakeholders and informed by local preferences. ¬© 2017 Elsevier B.V.",169,,43770,Energy landscape; Energy potential maps; Energy-conscious; Landscape architecture; Landscape planning; Stakeholder preferences; Climate change; Energy conservation; Fossil fuels; Population statistics; Renewable energy resources; Spatial variables measurement,

Spatial planning can play an important role in utilizing green infrastructure for adaptation. Yet climate change risks represent a different sort of challenge for planning institutions. This paper aims to address two issues arising from this challenge. First, it defines the concept of green infrastructure within the context of climate adaptation. Second, it identifies and puts into perspective institutional barriers to adopting green infrastructure for climate adaptation, including path dependence. We begin by arguing that there is growing confusion among planners and policy makers about what constitutes green infrastructure. Definitional ambiguity may contribute to inaction on climate change adaptation, because it muddies existing programs and initiatives that are to do with green-space more broadly, which in turn feeds path dependency. We then report empirical findings about how planners perceive the institutional challenge arising from climate change and the adoption of green infrastructure as an adaptive response. The paper concludes that spatial planners generally recognize multiple rationales associated with green infrastructure. However they are not particularly keen on institutional innovation and there is a tendency for path dependence. We propose a conceptual model that explicitly recognizes such institutional factors. This paper contributes to the literature by showing that agency and institutional dimensions are a limiting factor in advancing the concept of green infrastructure within the context of climate change adaptation. ¬© 2015 Elsevier B.V.",138,,155-163,Climate change; Green infrastructure; Institutional innovation; Spatial planning; Urban green space; Planning; Societies and institutions; Barriers to adoption; Climate change adaptation; Climate change risks; Institutional barriers; Institutional factors; Urban green spaces,

CE is defined as energy initiatives that place a high degree of emphasis on participation of local community members through ownership and control, where through doing so, benefits are created for the community. The trend has seen considerable growth in many countries over the last decade. Occurring simultaneously is a trend for local communities (e.g. municipalities) to create their own Local Energy Plans (LEPs) - a planning process that articulates energy-related actions (i.e. expected outcomes). While CE and LEPs both address energy activities in a local context, any further connection between these trends remains unclear. This research develops a framework, based on CE and LEP literature, to assess LEPs for their relevance to CE. The research analyses 77 LEPs from across Canada for the ways in which they address the three components that define CE: community participation, community ownership, and community capacity. The main findings are that LEPs have emerged as a process that is both relevant to CE and capable of strategically addressing its components. Despite this, LEPs do not appear to reveal a radically different approach to the ""closed and institutional"" models of traditional community involvement practices. The investigation suggests that for CE advocates, LEPs may be considered to be an important avenue to pursue CE ambitions. LEPs could increase their relevance to CE by improving the processes and actions related to all three CE components.",24,9,883-900,Local energy plans; community energy; community participation; localism; RENEWABLE ENERGY; BARRIERS; CANADA,

The transition from top-down to bottom-up elevates the concept of localism in project management for vulnerable groups. This change resonates well in community-based resource management schemes in privileging the locale in terms of generation of knowledge and how problems and remedies are enunciated. Localism conceptualised as devolving central-level government functions to non-state actors in social service delivery is contradictory and seems to negate state powers. This paper explores this trajectory to explicate the forms of localism and the contradictions from its multiple conceptualisations that influence energy access. Using qualitative methodology and interviews, it analyses renewable energy projects directed at poverty alleviation in rural communities in Nigeria while deploying a political ecology framework of power relations to highlight the dynamics of localism. While localism is touted as a constraint in the development process due to localism of action, the paper demonstrates its prospects and how scaling-up of operations may augur well for altering its conceptualisation and with far-reaching consequences for community sustainable energy projects.",19,8,933-946,climate change; community involvement; decentralization; development aid; development projects; fuelwood; renewable energy; resource management; rural communities,

It shows that during the last 200 years, a multiplication of energy use and a shift from renewable biomass towards coal and finally oil and natural gas as the dominating energy source have been observed. This energy transition was not a continuous process, but different phases in the energy transition can be distinguished. Also the spatial relations between the city and its resource-supplying hinterland changed. But growth in urban resource use was not simply causing an equal growth of the spatial imprint of urban consumption.

Although fishing effort distribution and marine habitat distribution and use are increasingly well understood, little research has quantified spatio-temporal changes in fishing effort or investigated drivers of these changes. Here, a holistic approach was taken to investigate socio-economic, environmental and technological drivers of change in fishing effort distribution of the Northumberland pot-fishery (2004‚Äì2014) using Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) analyses. BBNs were populated using large-scale high resolution spatial and temporal fisheries monitoring data, quantitative and qualitative interviews with fishers and expert opinion. Increases in fishing effort over time were explained by a combination of changes in fleet composition and fishers' behaviour. Increasing vessel and engine sizes, combined with an increased uptake of improved fishing technology have resulted in a greater ability for vessels to fish a greater number of pots. This increase in vessel and fishing capability has resulted in fishers' increased ability to fish in harsher weather conditions, as well as target specific areas or habitats quickly and opportunistically. Non-technological factors, such as declines in stocks of finfish and nephrops and the increasing operational costs of participating in these fisheries may have resulted in fishers solely fishing in the less regulated pot-fishery, targeting high value European lobster on a full-time basis. Increasing costs of pot-fishing in Northumberland coupled with stagnating crab and lobster landings prices may have resulted in increased fishing effort to maintain profitability. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",88,,189-203,Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) analyses; Ecosystem based fisheries management; Fishing effort distribution; Socio-ecological drivers; Bayesian analysis; environmental factor; fishery management; fishing vessel; price dynamics; profitability; socioeconomic conditions; spatiotemporal analysis; technology adoption; England; Northumberland; United Kingdom; Decapoda (Crustacea); Homarus gammarus; Nephrops,

For analysis, we used a framework describing six elements of successful scaling up: socio-political context, attributes of the intervention, attributes of the implementers, appropriate delivery strategy, the adopting community, and use of research to inform the scale-up process. A strong political will, alignment of the intervention with national priorities, and integration with the health care system were instrumental in the scaling up. The participatory approach in decision-making reinforced ownership at community level, and training about complementary feeding motivated mothers and women's groups to participate. However, the management of the complex intervention, limited human resources, and lack of incentives for female volunteers proved challenging. In the bartering model, the barter rate was accepted, but the bartering was hindered by unavailability of cereals and limited financial and material resources to contribute, threatening the project's sustainability. Scaling up strategies for nutrition interventions require sufficient time, thorough planning, and assessment of the community's capacity to contribute human, financial, and material resources.",14,2,,complementary feeding; Ethiopia; infant and child; nutrition; nutritional interventions; process evaluation; scaling-up; HEALTH INTERVENTIONS; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; NUTRITION; IMPLEMENTATION; FRAMEWORK; PROGRESS; SUCCESS; SYSTEMS; WORKERS,

Some recent developments and trends within the renewable energy sector that are responsible for this optimism are discussed. These include the concern for sustainable development that is becoming evident with the attention focused on the energy sector, the current changes in the country's economic policy that are leading to a rationalization of energy prices, adding transparency to the economic merits of renewable energy; thirdly over the last five years, some renewable sources have emerged as technically and economically viable alternatives in the energy sector, as a result more ambitious plans for their dissemination are now being launched. The paper includes a discussion of the recent changes in the implementing institutions, innovation in financing renewable technology investments, and a shift from financial to fiscal incentives. In addition, wind power generation, small hydro, photovoltaic and gasifier programmes are analysed in some detail. The paper concludes that for most of the rural population there are few options, particularly in the market-based framework, to alter the rapidly deteriorating biomass resource base. A top-down, centralized government initiative in designing and implementing rural energy interventions is recommended. However increased local-level participation has substantial payback, as the qualitative enhancement in the biogas programmes in many districts of India, with the involvement of private entrepreneurs as turn-key operators, would indicate.",18,3,213-224,appropriate technology; development policy; energy; energy policy; energy sources; photovoltaic cells; renewable energy; renewable resources; rural development,

Especially the development of new processes and facilities from lignocellulosic waste for advanced biofuel production represents an important field for academic research and industrial innovation within bioenergy development. The technical pathways for advanced biofuel production include the processes of cellulosic ethanol through lignocellulose hydrolysis-sugar fermentation, two-step hydrogenation (hydrodeoxygenation and hydroisomerization) of oils and fats (HVO), biomass gasification-Fischer Tropsch synthesis, biomass pyrolysis-upgrading of bio-oil and hydrotreating of algae oil via thermochemical, biochemical and hybrid conversions. Bio-oil, syngas, and sugars are used as platform chemicals. The progress of advanced biofuel development and the project activities in foreign countries were reviewed, which used lignocellulosic biomass, energy crops, municipal solid waste and organic waste as feedstock. The policies and regulations of advanced biofuels in America, Brazil, European Union and Canada, were described and compared. The current status of commercial and demonstration-scale facilities for advanced biofuel production was also discussed, mainly following the conversion processes of lignocellulosic ethanol, hydrotreated oils/fats (HVO) and biomass gasification-Fischer Tropsch synthesis. Although advanced biofuels have advantages for sustainable development, energy security and low carbon emission, the overall production and develop pathways cannot have cost parity with fossil-based fuels. The key barriers associated with its high cost include the unreliable feedstock availability, high production cost and uncertainty of policies. Biomass feedstock, especially lignocellulosic biomass, has huge annual amount worldwide, yet the significant hurdles for collecting, transportation and storage of biomass are needed to overcome in the scale-up of advanced biofuel production. And the limited lignocellulosic feedstock supply is also the result of uncertainties associated with its demand in the current market. Technical risk associated with scaling-up facilities is another restraining factor for investors due to the complexity of lignocellulosic feedstock and its conversion technologies, compared with starch-based corn ethanol. Financial support for pilot and demonstration plants can provide a valuable opportunity to validate technology from lab scale to commercial scale. Thus it would significantly reduce the technical and financial risks for new technology deployment. Cheap crude oil price in recent years is another reason, which resulted in the lack of policy irritation intention from government. As a consequence, the inconsistent developments of advanced biofuels cause its slowdown, and then form a vicious circle for limited feedstock supplements. The assessment of advanced biofuel in China was also discussed and its future development prospect was proposed. Due to the concern of food security in China, the only solution of biofuel production is using waste biomass via advanced technologies. HVO process is relatively easy and mature due to the utilization of bolt-on technologies by introduction of the advanced biofuel refineries into the existing petroleum refinery. Expanding the sources of oil feedstock by screening oil-fixing microorganisms, planting oil plant on marginal land will guarantee its long-term development in China. Cellulosic ethanol, bio-gasoline and biodiesel from lignocellulosic feedstock are essential guarantee for its perspective production. It is necessary to financially support cellulosic ethanol facilities of 100000 t/a and gasification-Fischer Tropsch facilities of 10000 t/a to demonstrate advanced biofuel production. And consistent policy measures are needed to provide investors with certainty about the future growth of advanced biofuel production in China, such as national mandatory addition of biofuel in transportation fuel, and adequate investment on demonstration project. ¬© 2017, Editorial Department of the T ansactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Uptake of polio vaccination in high-risk communities in this region has been considerably low despite routine and supplemental vaccination activities. Large numbers of children are left unvaccinated because of community misconceptions and distrust regarding the cause of the disease and the safety of the polio vaccine. The Majigi polio campaign was initiated in 2008 as a pilot trial in Gezawa, a local council with very low uptake of polio vaccination. The average monthly increase in the number of vaccinated children over the subsequent six months after the pilot trial was 1,047 [95% confidence interval (CI): 647-2045, P50.001]. An increasing trend in uptake of polio vaccination was also evident (P50.001). The outcome was consistent with a decrease or no trend in the detection of children with zero doses. The average monthly decrease in the number of children with zero doses was 6.2 (95% CI: 221 to 24, P50.353). Overall, there was a relative increase of approximately 310% in the polio vaccination uptake and a net reduction of 29% of never vaccinated children. The findings of this pilot test show that polio vaccination uptake can be enhanced by programs like Majigi that promote effective communication with the community. ¬© W. S.

'Smart technologies' are being developed to address emerging challenges of system integration, but their rates of future deployment remain uncertain. We argue that transition towards a system that can fully displace carbon generation sources will require expanding the focus of our efforts beyond technical solutions. Recognizing that change has social and technical dimensions, and that these interact strongly, we set out a socio-technical review that covers electricity infrastructure, citizens, business models and governance. It describes some of the socio-technical challenges that need to be addressed for the successful transition of the existing electricity systems.

While the fraction of population dependent on solid fuels has declined in these nations over the last 25 years, the number of people using them has risen. Here, we first assess current patterns of cooking energy use in these nations. We then apply a discrete model of household cooking choices and demand to simulate future pathways of clean cooking uptake and the outlook for achieving target 7.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. We find that by 2030, ensuing income growth is likely to enable 90% of urban populations in these nations to switch to using modern cooking energy services. However, without supporting policies, between 40% to 50% of rural Guatemalans and Hondurans, while over two-thirds of rural Nicaraguans, are likely to find clean fuels or stoves unaffordable in 2030. A targeted subsidy on modern fuels, like liquid petroleum gas (LPG), is the most effective policy mechanism we studied that could provide such support. A 50% subsidy policy on LPG targeted to the rural and urban poor population could, by 2030, make cooking with LPG affordable to an additional 7.3 million people in these countries. We estimate that such a policy would cost about $250 million per year and would have negligible greenhouse gas emissions impacts.

Yet these evidence-based interventions (EBIs) are not widely used in public systems, and they have limited reach (Glasgow et al., American Journal of Public Health 102:1274‚Äì1281, 2012; National Research Council and Institute of Medicine 2009; Prinz and Sanders, Clinical Psychology Review 27:739‚Äì749, 2007). To address this challenge and improve public health and well-being at a population level, the Society for Prevention Research (SPR) formed the Mapping Advances in Prevention Science (MAPS) IV Translation Research Task Force, which considered ways to scale up EBIs in five public systems: behavioral health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice, and public health. After reviewing other efforts to scale up EBIs in public systems, a common set of factors were identified as affecting scale-up in all five systems. The most important factor was the degree to which these systems enacted public policies (i.e., statutes, regulations, and guidance) requiring or recommending EBIs and provided public funds for EBIs. Across systems, other facilitators of scale-up were creating EBIs that are ready for scale-up, public awareness of and support for EBIs, community engagement and capacity to implement EBIs, leadership support for EBIs, a skilled workforce capable of delivering EBIs, and data monitoring and evaluation capacity. It was concluded that the following actions are needed to significantly increase EBI scale-up in public systems: (1) provide more public policies and funding to support the creation, testing, and scaling up of EBIs; (2) develop and evaluate specific frameworks that address systems level barriers impeding EBI scale-up; and (3) promote public support for EBIs, community capacity to implement EBIs at scale, and partnerships between community stakeholders, policy makers, practitioners, and scientists within and across systems. ¬© 2019, The Author(s).",,,,Behavioral health problems; Dissemination; Evidence-based policies; Evidence-based programs; Implementation; Scaling up; Type 2 research,

The country has embarked a reform process two decades ago to make a transformation from a rigid administrative bureaucracy to an adaptive management system that can cope up with the movements in today's society. Technology and Science is acknowledged by the government as a critical driver of the economic development of the country in the 21(st) century. However the country's administration of science and technology activities is still struggling in a mix of legacy inertia and reform efforts. Much efforts and time are needed before an effective national innovation system can be put into work. This paper aims to address the problem of effective transfer of research results from the government R&D agencies to industry in Vietnam. It will first review the process of legal development and the restructuring of the national science and technology system in the country since late 1980s. Then the technology transfer process from the state R&D agencies to industry will be examined and followed by the issues and challenges of the current system.

Since the concept's first appearance in 2007, the authors found a dominant amount of studies in the non-technological domains, including attempts to define and categorise cloud computing and the challenges and issues of the technology's adoption. Nonetheless, few researches are dedicated to determine the drivers of adopting cloud computing thus the literature is limited on this topic. As more adopters are becoming familiar with the technology and implementing cloud computing in their daily work, understanding what drives their adoption decision is essential to create opportunities for future cloud technologies to be tailored and aligned with the consumer's needs thus promotes exploitations of the technology's promising applications. This research takes a quantitative approach by developing and validating a theory-based conceptual model. Among the theories that are commonly applied in Information Systems research, the authors found Technology-Organisation-Environment framework can encapsulate the adoption's factors into one big picture. The authors conducted a secondary data analysis on the recent large-scale survey of IBM to investigate the drivers and barriers of cloud computing adoption. Structural Equation Modelling and Partial Least Square statistical methodologies provide rigid scientific procedures to validate the conceptual model. This study contributes a statistically validated conceptual model of the drivers and barriers of cloud computing adoption. In addition, the research provides a comparison between two different discussions (i.e., industry report and academic research) on the same topic and data. The findings benefits are twofold. First, it seeks to clarify the profound knowledge on the factors surrounding cloud adoption to better understanding cloud computing. Second, it also provides directions for future research by suggesting validations on the proposed model while discussing the limitations of analysing commercial survey.",,180-188,Acad Conferences Ltd,cloud computing; adoption; drivers; barriers; structural equation; modelling; Technology-Organisation-Environment-Framework,

Furthermore, the U.S. Energy Information Administration has predicted that growth in electricity use is projected to largely come from developing countries as defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). However, the transition to clean energy is occurring too slowly in rural parts of developing countries. Renewable energy provides the opportunity for sustainable energy to be provided to those living in rural areas of developing countries, who have not had access to clean energy. Renewable energy technology is necessary because traditional measures of energy access are not able to address the deficiencies in the affordability, reliability, and other barriers associated with renewable energy distribution. While there have been several successful rural electrification technologies in the past few years, sustainable technologies still have the potential to be unsuccessful if they fail to overcome the many barriers that stand in the way of energy progression in developing countries. Moreover, a product's technical performance is not a sound indicator of how well that product will be adopted by users. This paper argues that technical and social barriers to renewable energy dissemination have not been surmounted due to a lack of innovation in terms of engineering solutions. Innovative ""grid-free"" engineering products can enable developing countries to avoid a possible industrial revolution while still growing their economy, since they are not hindered by an electricity grid. This paper identifies technical barriers to renewable energy development from the literature, and suggests possible innovations that can aid rural areas of developing countries in achieving electrification. The technology explored in this paper include super capacitors, a ground-air thermoelectric generator, and photovoltaic solar cells, which all have the potential to provide energy access to those living in less urbanized areas of developing countries.",,,Amer Soc Mechanical Engineers,PERFORMANCE; ISSUES; ASIA,

The mHealth intervention was implemented in the study districts via mobile phones in the form of SMS voice messages, text messages, and phone call reminders. Our results show that participants who received follow-up call reminders and messages (10.2%) from health providers about their health expressed general satisfaction and high optimism toward receiving future follow-ups via their mobile phones. The high acceptability level was also demonstrated in the FGDs and KIIs. Overall, our findings showed that this mHealth intervention was an acceptable and feasible solution to the challenges of access to healthcare services seen in rural areas. Despite the high acceptability level, participants also highlighted barriers, such as limited or erratic power supply and poor mobile network connectivity, which need to be addressed. Conclusions: mHealth interventions targeting health providers and rural women have the potential to reduce barriers to equitable access to maternal and child healthcare services in these settings. These findings are of clear public health importance and are relevant to policy-makers in this area of service delivery and use; however, policy-makers and program implementers should be cautious of the challenges involved in the scale-up of such an intervention. ¬© 2018",168,,43678,Ghana; Health providers; Maternal and child health; mHealth; Rural settings; assessment method; child health; feasibility study; health policy; health services; maternal health; policy making; public health; rural population; service provision; adolescent; adult; Article; child health care; controlled study; expectation; family planning; female; health care access; health care utilization; health education; human; lactation; maternal care; newborn care; patient satisfaction; perception; postnatal care; pregnant woman; prenatal care; preventive health service; qualitative research; quantitative study; rural area; text messaging; trust; voice mail; attitude to health; child; health care delivery; health personnel attitude; information processing; maternal child health care; mobile phone; mother; pregnancy; psychology; questionnaire; rural health care; statistics and numerical data; telemedicine; Upper West Region; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cell Phone; Feasibility Studies; Focus Groups; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Maternal-Child Health Services; Mothers; Pregnant Women; Rural Health Services; Surveys and Questionnaires,

This survey sought the opinions of dietetics practitioners on personalised nutrition and related technologies to understand the facilitators and barriers to its application in practice. Method: A cross-section of registered dietitians were recruited in the USA, UK, Australia, Canada, Israel, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, and South Africa. The questionnaire sought their views on the risks of genetics technology, the ethics of genetic testing, the usefulness of new personalised nutrition technologies, entrepreneurism, and the perceived importance of new technologies to dietetics. Validated scales were included to assess personality (Big Five) and self-efficacy (NGSEI). The survey was available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the integration of nutrigenetic testing into practice, and to identify factors associated with the perceived importance of bio-information, and mobile technology to dietetics practice. Results: A total of 323 responses (response rate 19.7%) were analysed. Dietetics practitioners who had integrated personalised nutrition technology into practice perceived technologies to be less risky (p = 0.02), biotechnology to be more important (p < 0.01), and professional skills to be less important (p = 0.04) than those who had not. They were also more likely to see themselves as entrepreneurs (p < 0.01) and to perceive lower risks to be associated with technology (p < 0.01). Practitioners of nutrigenetics were lower on neuroticism (p < 0.01) and higher on self-efficacy (p < 0.01), extraversion (p < 0.01), and agreeableness (p < 0.01). A higher perceived importance of biotechnology to dietetics practice was associated with higher perceived usefulness of omics tests (p < 0.01). Perceived importance of information technology was associated with the perceived importance of biotechnology (p < 0.01). Mobile technology was perceived as important by dietitians with the highest level of education (p = 0.02). Conclusions: For dietitians to practice technology-enabled personalised nutrition, training will be required to enhance self-efficacy, address the risks perceived to be associated with new technologies, and instil an entrepreneurial mindset. ¬© 2019 S.

Interview results revealed that political interference and elite control hinder community participation at local level. Moreover, it is an obstacle that impedes community participation in local community-led development activities. Building capacity at local level is an important ingredient for sustainable development, as it not only provides local stakeholders with an opportunity to participate in decision-making, but also enables ""community ownership"", a key component of empowerment.

Here, we synthesise the push and pull approaches reported in the literature and employed in practice to achieve sustainable and resilient cities. First, we present a literature review which identified the major research fields on transition theories, frameworks and methods that underpin this concept. We analyse the conditions for change, identify enablers or triggers for change at governance level for transitioning a city towards sustainability and resilience. We discuss the theories, frameworks and methods which can be used to address the urban climate change challenge at city level. Second, we present an empirical approach based on stakeholder participation that we conducted to detect the conditions for change. We report on the design and implementation of stakeholder exercises that helped us detecting the conditions for changes. Third, we combine the information obtained from these stakeholder exercises with that extracted from the literature in order to provide a fuller picture on how stimulate the transition and transformation to achieve sustainable and resilient cities. Based on our literature review and empirical approach, we formulate an integrated conceptual model for transition that enables the design of adaptation (and mitigation) strategies that consider the triggers of change. Uniquely we identified 8 triggers of change, including authority and political leadership, learning from disasters, co-responsibility, increased public-private interface, social participation and the living lab approach to innovation. The proposed model can be applied to the whole city or to a certain sector of the city (e.g. energy). We demonstrate that triggers of change help to overcome planning and implementation barriers and move the socio-ecological and socio-technical systems of any city towards those of a resilient city.",94,,410-418,Transition; Transformation; Triggers of change; Barriers; Climate change; adaptation; Conceptual framework; CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE; DEJA-VU; PATHWAYS; MANAGEMENT; POLICY; TECHNOLOGY; COMPLEXITY; MITIGATION; BARRIERS,

This situation could be improved by using biogas. This paper analyses the current status of the domestic biogas sector in Ethiopia and identifies barriers and drivers that influence its development and further growth. The analytical framework used for the analysis combines the Multi Level Perspective (MLP) and Strategic Niche Management (SNM). The information sources are: desk study through literature and internet research, online interviews and questionnaires with Ethiopian stakeholders, and an extensive field study including a large number of interviews with stakeholders inside and outside Ethiopia. The biogas sector in Ethiopia started with the launch of the National Domestic Biogas (NBPE) programme in 2008, which has led to the dissemination of over 8000 biodigesters so far, about 60% of what was initially intended. The use of domestic biogas has been triggered by the energy crisis in Ethiopia and the suitability of the technology with the physical geography. However, the dissemination has been affected by factors such as economic instability, poverty and illiteracy. Also, many Ethiopian farmers are trapped in a lock-in, where due to their limited purchasing power they cannot afford the niche technology; at least in the way it is being disseminated. Within the emerging biogas sector, the NBPE designated a diverse set of actors to contribute to the implementation of the niche technology. However, their alignment is poor and the private sector is not involved. Expectations have had to be lowered because targets were not met. Also, learning processes are not optimal. The paper is innovative because it provides an up-to-date review of status of and bottlenecks and drivers in the biogas sector in Ethiopia and it provides more insight in the applicability of the SNM and MLP frameworks to a sustainable innovation in a developing country.

To achieve this goal, substantial financial and technological investments will be required at a rate far exceeding historical levels. Sub-Saharan Africa has a 30.5% electrification rate and policy reform issues to improve electrification have been poorly implemented thereby sprinkling doubt as to whether the region would be able to achieve 100% access to electricity for all by the year 2030. Sub-Saharan Africa faces a tough challenge in-order to achieve universal access to modern energy services since the region fails to attract energy sector investments. There is also a general perception that the region contributes very little to global greenhouse gas emissions hence offers few opportunities to reduce these emissions consequently missing out on attracting climate finance projects. A guarantee of power purchase has been shown to attract energy sector investments. However, guarantees of power purchases such as Feed-in Tariffs, are experiencing slow market growth in developing countries because of a range of technical, regulatory and financial barriers. Using Malawi as a case study of a developing country, this review provides a perspective from a Sub-Saharan Africa Least Developed Country as to the various electrification, renewable energy deployment and climate change management challenges that still require urgent attention. This study shows that despite the perceived regulatory and financial challenges, Malawi can integrate and use a combination of (adapted) price guarantee schemes, cross subsidies and environmental taxes in -order to support initiatives aimed at supporting the country's development of renewable energy sources and hence indirectly support the Sustainable Energy for All Initiative.

A systematic review approach was used to select, critically analyze and synthesize findings of various studies in the region. The review showed that SRETs, if efficiently and uninterruptedly used, could significantly reduce household consumptions of traditional biomass and fossil fuels, and hence, can reduce deforestation, forest degradation and carbon emissions from biomass energy use at household levels. The FAO charcoal to dry wood conversion rate and the IPCC conversion factor of fuelwood from dry weight to CO2 equivalent were used to estimate potential wood fuel and CO(2)e emissions savings. Our conservative estimates based on the analysis of the evidence indicated that domestic biogas and improved cook stoves distributed up to now have a combined potential of saving 0.307-3.100 million tons of wood fuel and 0.562-5.673 million tons of CO(2)e emissions per country per year. However, when compared to the annual biomass energy consumptions of each country, the potential wood fuel savings from the biogas plants and improved cooks-stoves disseminated so far do not appear to offset more than 7.2% of the national demands of the respective countries.

However, there are large differences across the literature that currently present barriers to decision making. Here, the compiled inventory of the blue water use of power production from existing studies allowed to uncover the characteristics of water use and to investigate current uncertainties. The results show that photovoltaics, wind power, and run-of-the-river hydropower consume relatively little water, whereas reservoir hydropower and woody and herbaceous biomass can have an extremely large water footprint. The water consumption of power production can differ greatly across countries due to different geographic conditions. Only a few studies provided the values for the influencing factors of water use, such as the capacity factor. Values that are reported came mainly from assumptions and other literature rather than direct measurement. Omitting a life cycle stage may lead to significant underestimations. Water scarcity is attracting more attention, but the few existing results are not useable for a regional comparison due to data gaps and inconsistent measurements. In the future, a clear and detailed definition of the water footprint and system boundary of power production is essential to improving comparisons and energy systems modelling. ¬© 2019 The Authors",115,,,Electricity generation; Energy technology; Energy-water nexus; Life cycle assessment; Water footprint; Water scarcity; Artificial life; Decision making; Electric power generation; Hydroelectric power; Life cycle; Reservoirs (water); Water supply; Wind power; Energy technologies; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Water conservation,

The objectives of these programs have been to reduce fuel use and hence reduce deforestation, and improve the health conditions of users by reducing environmental emissions. Other objectives include improving the social life of people in developing countries and reducing global climate change. The success of improved Cookstove programs has been reported as mixed. While some of the programs have achieved their target objectives, many of them have failed. This paper reviews the literature of improved Cookstove programs around the world. It starts with a review of some selected Cookstove technologies, classified by the types of fuel they burn and whether they are fixed or portable. This is followed by a review of different Cookstove programs, with the objective of finding the factors that determine their success, the form they should take, and the role played by the stakeholders. It is found that the success of the programs depends on the factors such as: compatibility of technical parameters of stoves with social expectations, consistency with local needs and culture, attitude of the users who are often afraid adopting new technology, and the stove cost. Also programs that use a â€œbottom-upâ€� strategy, where users and local artisans play participatory roles in establishing a self-sustaining industry ensure success of the program.",33,,625-635,Improved Cookstove technologies; Rural energy demand; Sustainable fuelwood supply; Developing country×³s energy,

Based on 358 respondents from rural households in Changting County, as well as additional statistical data, we present strong evidence in support of the argument that changes in the livelihoods of rural households lead to fuelwood substitution and finally, hilly ecosystem restoration. Important factors influencing fuelwood substitution are closely linked with changes in rural livelihoods: off-farm employment and agricultural specialization. Therefore, these changes are argued to be the primary driving force of fuelwood substitution. Reasons include the increasing opportunity costs of fuelwood collection, increases in household income, and decreases in household energy consumption for cooking, feeding and heating. Such changes have unexpectedly caused significant progress in hilly ecosystem restoration, particularly in mitigation of soil erosion and forest degradation. Thus, it is suggested that the progressive change and improvement in the livelihoods of rural households should be included in the mix of policies intended to restore hilly ecosystems.",16,,,,

Responsiveness for affordable electricity access to its residents induced implementation of off-grid and consumer driven energy models like Community Energy (CE), playing significant role in meeting national energy demand in developed countries. It is evident from energy secured nations that centralized planning and electrification is not alone sufficient for meeting energy security. Renewable CE model is predicted to emerge as an effective system of clean energy access to off-grid communities while reducing emissions vividly. In past few years, cases of renewable CE system have been reported in India as well. Hence, it becomes pertinent to assess the extent of CE projects in Indian context, however a comprehensive landscape of such projects is currently lacking. This paper attempts to profile the status of CE projects with their scope and relevance to ensure national energy security. Six diversified case studies of CE projects are analysed by applying actor network theory. Role of community participation in implementation of these projects and its socio-economic impact on localized growth is represented by reviewing detailed case-studies. Qualitative analysis reveals parameters across diversified CE projects in India leading to an assessment framework for sustainable replication in other regions. Insights provide basis to identify associated challenges and incentives with CE projects, policy implications in interest of developers, end users, beneficiaries, promoters and towards emission reduction.",108,,194-208,Community energy; Renewable sources; Energy security; Sustainability,

However, EnM was not implemented within industry with all its potential to improve energy security, raise the maturity level of EnM and increase sustainability. According to the results of previous empirical investigations, the expected interest in energy programs is not found and there is no clear understanding about program adoption criteria within an industry. Keeping in mind the adoption of energy investment through conformation with financial analysis and choosing the investments through contextual factors in the organization (e.g. organizational energy culture, power relationships, EnM system, expertise availability, managers' mindset) together with characteristics of EnM program as two macro perspectives in energy efficiency literature, this paper aims to understand the main driving factors which lead organizations to either adopt or not adopt a particular program (always with respect to energy management). Moreover, it aims to express the impact of those driving forces of implementing a successful EnM program which could contribute to better understanding of suitable EnM configuration. The investigation has been conducted as a multiple case study involving 15 manufacturing companies of varying size and in different sectors located in Sweden. After analyzing the minimum required steps to establish EnM, assessing the adoption of practices according to their energy strategy, and through assessing EnM maturity level, we found a low level of risk (which arises from lack of certainty and awareness) and the program's alignment with the core business as prominent driving factors for all sizes which foster positive investment decision¬†making through top management. On the contrary, complexity of industry (for large manufacturing companies) and access to capital (for small and medium-sized companies) are the main barriers to adopting those programs. ¬© 2017",74,,538-547,Assessment; Driving factors; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Manufacturing industry; Energy policy; Energy security; Macros; Manufacture; Risk assessment; Empirical investigation; Energy management programs; Investment decisions; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing industries; Small and medium-sized companies; Investments,

Billions more endure awfully intermittent service even when connected to the grid. Most of these access challenged communities are in the Global South and may benefit from surging spread of distributed energy resources. However, associated investment necessity is large and so is the time required to address infrastructural bottlenecks. Recognising criticality of universal access to affordable, eco-friendly and reliable electricity in inclusive human development, the United Nations adopted ‚Äòaffordable and clean energy' as one of the Sustainable Development Goals. To treasure electricity access, measurement of the same is important. The evolution of electricity access measurement has given rise to multi-tier, multi-parameter matrix. This improved measurement framework has facilitated researchers and policymakers in capturing various electricity access parameters in order to script focused energy strategy for the common man. This paper studies electricity availability, consumer aspiration and prevailing consumption in an impoverished, isolated, high-altitude valley, nestled in the Himalayas in India. It outlines evolving technology-aided, access measurement supported innovative access tier advancement opportunities in the valley. The result underscores the importance of consumer-focused approach for improving infrastructure utilisation. Consumer collaboration may result in fast, economical access advancement. Supply reliability may transform from abrupt complete disruption to gradual, cognisant decay. Such transition may encourage consumers to avoid costly, individual backup and instead use available resources sensibly. Embedding aspiration-supporting nudge in electricity regulation may promote co-operation, helping empowered consumers in scaling access tier affordably.",110,,13-27,Consumer aspiration; Consumption collaboration; Metering; Nudge; Global south,

However, most energy providers are reluctant to venture in rural regions of developing countries. These regions are generally characterized by: low-income populations, minimum access to electricity, rare access to financial services or loans. In this paper we present the potential of rice husk for rural electrification in Cambodia. Rice husk is locally abundant at almost no cost, with a production over 9.3 million tons paddy rice in 2014 for a total population of about 15 million people. The conversion of rice husk into electricity through gasification or thermally generated electricity is a well-known technology. Rice husk can contribute in a sustainable manner to grant access to electricity to Cambodian rural population and is more reliable and competitive with reference to other renewable energy sources of electricity. The present investigation focuses on the study of self-sustaining energy service model to provide grid quality power to rural populations without the need of subsidies. In Cambodia, many rice mills are operating in rural and semi-urban areas. Some of these mills are now using rice husk for electricity production for industries and rural households, generally for lighting at low cost. We believe that the power systems focusing on both power requirements for the industry such rice mills and power requirements for the people living in the neighboring villages/rural areas at affordable tariff could become the most appropriate solution for the sustainable rural electrification. Along with the potential of rice husk for rural electrification in Cambodia, we present a financially viable business model to provide the grid quality power to rural population without grant or subsidy.",44,,530-542,biomass; case studies; economic viability; electricity; renewable energy; rice husks; rural areas; rural population; sustainability,

It thus dedicates important efforts to take advantage of existing energy sources. Countries have different and unique energy performances depending on the combination of resources, policies, and structures created to exploit them. Some are successful in their attempt to optimize their energy resources while others are not. This is the case of Venezuela, which faces a contradictory energy performance. Despite its substantial available renewable and non-renewable energy resources, it presents a severe energy crisis. This crisis manifests itself in frequent and extended energy blackouts and electricity services alterations, which affect all society. With the aim to propose some solutions, the authors make an attempt to identify the origin of the Venezuelan energy crisis, unexplainable in a country which two decades ago was an indisputable world energy leader. The authors evaluate the relationship among energy and sustainability, the renewable potential existing in Venezuela, as well as some new data and key insights regarding its energy framework. Special reference is made to infrastructure energy projects in Venezuela. The discussion leads to the identification of the structural problems that cause such a crisis and include some recommendations. The authors propose a thorough study of this case in order to consider it as an international reference and to avoid the repetition of similar cases in the future. Finally, an entirely new orientation of the Venezuelan energy framework and the strategies that include the revision of the current energy policies and the management of this sector are proposed. Such proposals are presented to help Venezuela in its transition to a new energy stage in which renewable energy, knowledge and sustainable criteria become the fundamental resources to address the country on its path to sustainability.",105,,415-426,Sustainability; Competitiveness; Energy crisis; Energy transition; Power supply; Infrastructure; Venezuela,

The primary aim of this research is to provide better understanding of the cost structures of PV/hybrid mini-grid projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. The review on existing literature reveals significant lack of transparency and inconsistencies in PV/hybrid mini-grid costs. This paper aims to support the fact that there still remains a strong need to reduce the gap between current business model concepts and successfully implemented scale-up electrification models. Based on the experience of PV/hybrid mini-grids projects implemented in various rural communities of SSA, we propose a multi-dimensional cost analysis with a standardised break-down of the real costs of installed projects. Subsequently, we assess the main social and environmental implications and we identify barriers that appear to hinder successful PV mini-grid planning and subsequent implementation in SSA. Africa has the unique opportunity to utilize renewable energy as a primary energy source. Indeed, the continent has the potential to bring electricity especially to its rural population by means of PV/hybrid mini-grids. However, the capability of public and private sector investors to pre-evaluate projects is limited by the lack of locally available information on PV/hybrid mini-grid costs or the reliability of data (when available). Multi-dimensional cost analysis of social and environmental impacts from this study highlight that PV/hybrid mini-grids offer a unique opportunity to create a standardised framework for quantifying costs of PV/hybrid mini-grids in SSA, that can support decision-making processes for designing viable business models. Findings show that there is a strong need to minimise the data quality gap between current business model and that of successfully implemented PV/hybrid mini-grids electrification projects. This gap could be mitigated through studying the issues that influence mini-grid costs (both hardware and software). In addition to understanding other factors that can influence project costs such as the market maturity and remoteness of the site, organisation capability, development approach, and level of community involvement. Regarding policy considerations, stronger political will coupled with proactive rural electrification strategies and targeted renewable energy regulatory framework would be essential in order to establish viable dynamic domestic market for off grid renewables. In the presented benchmarking analysis, the experiences of public and private development organisations are synchronized to contribute to the furthest extent possible to facilitate the assessment. Those include the disaggregation of component costs according to their unit in order to make comparison more accurate and include site-specific parameters in the discussion of costs. ¬© 2018 The Authors",91,,1148-1161,Business model; Cost data harmonization; Energy Development policy; Hybrid mini-grid; LCOE; Photovoltaic (PV); Rural electrification; Sub-Saharan Africa(SSA); Technology learning; Commerce; Cost accounting; Costs; Decision making; Electric utilities; Environmental impact; Investments; Life cycle; Rural areas; Business modeling; Cost data; Energy development; Mini grids; Photovoltaic; Sub-saharan africa; Cost benefit analysis,

This review aims to determine the biomass resources, value prospective, conversion strategy and biofuel policy in the country. The present energy system and the potential of the broad areas of energy crops, agricultural crop residues, forest product residues, urban wastes and animal wastes are explored. The study on the availability of various biomass resources, together with a brief description of the conversion processes of these resources into biofuel is inspected. The current energy system shows a large variation between urban and rural consumption. Nearly the entire rural households depend on traditional biomass-based energy for cooking, while about 90% of urban households use electricity for lighting. The estimated total amount of biomass resource available for energy in Ethiopia in 2014-2015 is 1120 million tons with the annual energy potential of 46.91 million tons of coal equivalent and the annually exploitable agro-wastes account for 18 million tons. This enormous availability of biomass gives an immense potential to make the most of the biofuel expanding strategies in Ethiopia.

The principal factors controlling its dissemination include: policies and institutions, financial constraint, subsidies, availability of inputs, awareness about the technology, consumers' considerations, and success stories about the technology. However, biogas technology is a multipurpose technology which assists in addressing economic, health, social and environmental problems simultaneously. Thus, development and dissemination of the technology certainly minimize energy poverty and improve peoples' status in the energy ladder. In line with this, Ethiopia has completed implementing the first phase (2009-2013) of its National Biogas Programme and has started implementing its second phase. During the first phase, it was able to disseminate 57.6% the total 14,000 domestic biogas plants planned for the period. Though the technology was introduced about five decades ago into the country, biogas installations constructed prior to the establishment of the National Biogas Programme were having varied digester models, lacked standards and central coordination and their entire number was not more than 1000.

Moreover, governmental policy makers tend to support measures for early-stage ventures or university spin-offs, based on the assumption that sustainable energy technologies primarily arise from early-stage technology development. Attention has recently been shifting to SMEs, which can help accelerate the energy transition. By combining a literature review with an explorative multiple case study of 20 SMEs in the Dutch sustainable energy sector, this article identified barriers and drivers for technology commercialization by SMEs. A country-specific barrier is the large consumption of natural gas by Dutch households, which strongly inhibits the successful scale-up of new technologies. The study found several managerial, financial, technological and policy-related barriers and drivers which affect technology commercialization of sustainable energy technologies by SMEs. These barriers and drivers were further assessed in an actor-based analysis, which suggests that the various barriers and drivers arise from the interactions between policy makers, industry partners and end-users. The paper also discusses the policy implications of the barriers and drivers identified, and outlines several challenges for future research. ¬© 2019 The Author(s)",112,,114-126,Barriers; Drivers; SMEs; Sustainability transition; Technology commercialization; Decision making; Energy conservation; Public policy; Truck drivers; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Sustainable energy systems; Sustainable energy technology; Technology commercializations; Technology development; Electric energy storage,

However, in the past deployment has been strongly dependent on policy support. With the recent rapid decrease in module costs, rooftop PV is exhibiting a growing potential to be an attractive investment even in the absence of subsidies. While many drivers of economic performance have been investigated in isolation, a holistic analysis of how realistic combinations of influencing factors determine rooftop PV's economics is still missing. We identify the most important influencing factors through a comprehensive review of the literature. We then provide a model-based techno-economic analysis of a small-scale grid-connected residential building PV system, assessing how region-specific geographic, technological, and economic parameters jointly influence performance. We find that in many regions rooftop PV can already today be an attractive investment, even in the absence of subsidies. No regional influencing factor can in isolation guarantee or impede performance. Moreover, in most regions it might be possible to further improve economic performance. Self-consumption is identified as a likely driver of value in the future, while low electricity prices (and thus fossil fuel subsidies) present a powerful barrier in some regions. Based on these insights, we discuss implications for policy makers and investors with regard to recognizing and shaping attractive markets and investments. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although conventional rural electrification projects have largely deployed diesel generators for their low upfront cost, this study demonstrates the economic competitiveness of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and solar energy in enhancing rural energy access. Contrary to the conventional belief that these relatively new technologies are exorbitant options for low income groups, this study provides a practical solution for the leap-frogging of developing countries by proving that enhanced energy efficiency can offset the high upfront-cost of new technology options. This study compares performance among various energy configurations using HOMER and examines economic aspects of each option. For simulation, three load scenarios are designed and used to better reflect different local energy demands in rural villages. Findings confirm that a hybrid smart grid system maintains its economic and technical competitiveness under changing load conditions, while diesel based power generation is still necessary to ensure stable power supply. Finally, cost comparison with a grid extension option which the government of Myanmar is currently pursuing under its National Electrification Plan will reaffirm that the country should consider extensive adoption of sustainable energy technologies.",82,Part 1,1187-1194,efficiency; electricity supplies; rural areas; solar energy; sustainability,

The country's national low carbon energy strategy aims to bring the share of renewables in electricity production to 50% by 2050. Despite the considerable renewable energy resource base, and ambitious deployment targets, the current contribution of non-hydro renewable energy to final electricity demand is less than one percent. Adoption of renewable energy technologies in a fossil fuel resource-rich country like Kazakhstan remains a big challenge but current low oil prices and a weakening economy may offer new opportunities. Deploying an Analytical Hierarchy Process methodology we identify the most significant barriers to uptake of renewable energy in the context of the electricity sector. The main factors preventing the penetration and scale-up of renewables include: a political and regulatory framework which supports and promotes a continued focus on fossil fuels, supported in part by regional geopolitics; a lack of awareness of sustainable alternative energy generation systems and a combination of social poverty and poor education in communities that are most likely to benefit from broadly distributed renewable technologies; market conditions driven by current electricity tariffs; inefficient but incumbent power technologies; and a high-risk business environment. Ranking barriers by importance will provide practitioners and regulators a mechanism to improve policies and incentivize renewable energy uptake in Kazakhstan and other resource-rich transition economies in Central Asia. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd",66,,120-136,Barriers; Central Asia; Fossil fuel; Kazakhstan; Renewable energy; Carbon; Economic and social effects; Energy resources; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Fuels; Natural resources; Alternative energy generation; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Economic and social benefits; Renewable energies; Renewable energy technologies; Renewable energy resources,

A transition of this sector towards sustainable one is facing many challenges in terms of suitable technology and energy resources. Especially challenging transition is envisaged for heavy-weight, long-range vehicles and airplanes. A detailed literature review was carried out in order to detect the current state of the research on clean transport sector, as well as to point out the gaps in the research. In order to calculate the resources needed for the transition towards completely renewable transport sector, four main alternatives to the current fossil fuel systems were assessed and their potential was quantified, i.e. biofuels, hydrogen, synthetic fuels (electrofuels) and electricity. Results showed that electric modes of transport have the largest benefits and should be the main aim of the transport transition. It was calculated that 72.3% of the transport energy demand on the EU level could be directly electrified by the technology existing today. For the remaining part of the transport sector a significant demand for energy resources exists, i.e. 3069 TWh of additional biomass was needed in the case of biofuels utilization scenario while 2775 TWh of electricity and 925 TWh of heat were needed in the case of renewable electrofuels produced using solid oxide electrolysis scenario. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",82,,1823-1838,"Biofuels, hydrogen; Electric vehicles; Electrofuels; Renewable transport; Synthetic fuels; Biofuels; Energy management; Energy resources; Fossil fuel deposits; Fuels; Energy demands; European union; Literature reviews; Sustainable energy systems; Transport energy; Transport sectors",

However, few residential energy system models have been developed for the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region and they do not account for the key diversities of energy use within the sector. This paper addresses this gap by developing a new residential energy model for Nigeria‚Äîthe most populous country in SSA. The model is then used to explore different energy transition scenarios for the sector. Results indicate that the final energy consumption of the rural households will reduce and that of the urban households will increase significantly by 2050 when compared to the base year levels. The results indicate that cooking remains the most energy-intensive end-use. Analysis of the scenarios reveals that realising Sustainable Development Goal number 7 in Nigeria will drastically reduce the final energy demand of the sector. The transition from fuelwood to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking will reduce indoor air pollutants considerably but will increase CO2 emissions by 2050. The results also indicate that including the cost of externalities in energy cost makes electricity and biogas more economically viable options for cooking. While the model results are insightful, the paper argues that robust and dedicated policies are needed for a sustainable energy transition of the Nigerian residential sector.",117,,109510,Residential sector; TIMES model; Energy transition; Energy policy; SDG 7; Nigeria,

Consequently, the current low rates of electrification in many SSA countries has been identified as the most pressing obstacle to economic growth, more important than access to finance, red tape or corruption. Despite the presence of numerous initiatives for promoting energy access in Africa, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) calling for universal access to energy by 2030, Africa might still not be able to achieve universal energy access by 2030. Through an analysis of case studies, research articles, policy briefs and project reports this paper sought to investigate the policies, strategies and innovations that could help expedite SSA's progress towards universal energy access before 2030. This investigation revealed that an emphasis on rural electrification and linking energy access to agriculture and irrigation development as the case was in Viet Nam, could successfully diversify African economies and mitigate the negative perceptions about Africa's growth prospects and energy sectors that global economic shocks instigate. Additionally, the operations of Power Africa, the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) Initiative and the China South-South Climate Cooperation Fund can either significantly improve the financing and regulatory frameworks for SSA's energy sectors or constrain economic development in SSA by promoting rent-seeking and corruption which culminates into a 'climate finance curse'. Consequently, these initiatives can only facilitate inclusive growth as envisioned in the SDGs if SSA develops or strengthens institutions to coordinate and harmonise investments and aid from such autonomous diverse sources.",94,,600-608,agricultural development; attitudes; climate change; coping strategies; economic growth; electrification; energy policy; innovations; irrigation; objectives; renewable energy; rural areas; sustainability,

Given its extraordinary market growth, a better understanding of the various market and social factors affecting residential consumers' PV purchasing decisions is required for policy makers to create efficient support mechanisms, by industry participants to better target marketing activities, and for more informed planning of centralised electricity generation and network infrastructure development. This paper reports on an analysis of the behavioural drivers of households as decision-making units fulfilling an intention to adopt PV. Drawing upon Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory and using a logistic regression choice model, the actual outcomes of the residential PV market are examined in the state of Queensland, Australia. A recent survey of more than 8000 households is used to investigate the difference in demographic and motivational factors among households with the stated intention to purchase PV with those that have already adopted the technology. Our findings suggest that PV is the technology of the middle class. This reasoning is made based on surveyees' stated concerns over rising electricity bills and survey data which indicates that economic life events have a significant influence over perceptions of affordability. Households need to be concerned with rising electricity bills to be motivated to adopt PV, but must also have access to sufficient capital to afford its upfront cost. Familiarity with the technology appeared to reduce adoption motivations based on self-sufficiency and intentions to go off grid. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",93,,642-651,Adoption intention; Households choice; Logistic regression; Motivational factors; Solar photovoltaic; Behavioral research; Commerce; Decision making; Housing; Marketing; Regression analysis; Solar concentrators; Surveys; Logistic regressions; Solar photovoltaics; Solar power generation,

Improving energy services for poor households in developing countries remains one of the most pressing challenges facing the development community. Earlier studies suggest in South Asia the households are likely to follow the energy ladder comprising fuels like dung, crop residue, firewood, kerosene, gobar gas, LPG, and electricity for cooking purposes. Evidence suggests that while it is possible to observe such transition in urban and semi-urban areas, the change is very slow in rural areas. In rural Pakistan, the access to commercial energy resources is limited, the majority of the households still heavily rely on traditional methods of using wood, animal waste and crop waste for domestic fuel needs. Efficiencies of use are very low and most of the potential is wasted because of non-scientific conventional technologies. Consequently there is an obligatory need to develop modern bio-energy technologies since renewable resources may serve to supplement the long-term energy needs of Pakistan to a significant level. Though the bio-resource base of Pakistan is substantial, its contribution to useful energy is low. In this paper we called attention to issues and challenges in biomass utilization for energy in Pakistan in context of sustainable development. This paper has identified areas in Pakistan where there is considerable scope to modernize biomass energy production delivery systems to provide varied energy carriers such as electricity, industrial and domestic fuel and gases. Barriers are examined over the whole biomass energy spectrum and policy issue and institutional roles and responsibilities are discussed. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although technical barriers in biogas technologies have been mostly addressed, there are persisting gaps in knowledge about the role of administrative (regulatory) and market-based policy instruments in the waste-to-energy value chain for facilitating biogas adoption. Therefore, using the case of Sri Lanka, this study investigates policy instruments along the waste-to-energy value chain that affect biogas technology adoption. Additionally, a consistent analytical framework is developed for simultaneously assessing technical and economic potentials as well as environmental impacts of biogas adoption at large scales. Quantitative assessments are complemented with qualitative assessments including key expert interviews. The findings indicate that biogas energy potential from organic waste recycling is 29‚Äì42 PJ which accounts for 16‚Äì23% of the household energy demand. Biogas technology adoptions also offset 3.9‚Äì4.8 million tons of CO2 equivalent gases (or 8.6‚àí 10.8% of nationwide GHG emissions). Despite considerable technical potential and positive environmental externalities, biogas adoptions in Sri Lanka are mainly occurring through administrative enforcement rather than market-based incentives.

Because of a lack of other commercial sources of energy, the country relies heavily on traditional fuel source, especially firewood. In order to solve the energy problem in rural areas, the country initiated production and distribution of several renewable energy technologies. Among several technologies, biogas has been proved to be viable and emerged as a promising technology. It has been one of the most successful models for the production of clean, environmental friendly, cost effective source of energy and has multiple benefits. In this paper we present the current state and discuss benefits of the biogas technology in Nepal. Improved health, increased crop productivity, saved time for women are some of the major benefits to the users. It provides economic benefit to the country through reduced deforestation and carbon trading. In addition, by reducing green house gas emission, the technology helps in mitigating global warming and climate change. Thus biogas is a renewable, sustainable and clean source of energy that provides multiple benefits; locally and globally. With some exception, cattle dung has been used primarily as an input and the technology is limited to households only.

In an effort to improve the energy situation as well as to improve the indoor environment, Nepal's government has initiated the adoption and implementation of efficient biomass technologies in Nepal. Improved health and sanitation, reduced fuelwood consumption, improved social and physical facilities, and reduced drudgery for women are some of the major benefits of efficient biomass technologies to the rural households. Use of biogas reduces the fuelwood consumption by 2Â tons/yr and workload by 1100Â h/yr. Similarly, use of improved cooking stove can increases the efficiency up to 15â€“20% and reduces greenhouse gases of 1.09Â tCO2eq/yr as compared to the traditional cooking stove. Despite continuous effort from government and foreign donors, the task of rapid dissemination of the efficient biomass technologies to more remote and isolated rural communities is still challenging in Nepal.

However, system cost is not the only barrier faced by solar adopters. Potential adopters also face various informational barriers, leading to high indirect costs during the information search process. There is a significant gap in the literature for empirical work on solar adoption linking how the information context (installer marketing; neighbors with solar, i.e., peer effects; etc.) interacts with a potential adopter's motivations to impact decision outcomes. To address this gap we present results of a new survey on the decision-making process of residential PV adopters in northern California. The main aspects of our analysis include: salient motivating factors, information gathering process, peer effects, role of installers, and factors driving the choice of outright purchase versus third-party ownership (e.g., leasing) modes of adoption. We find that installers and neighbors play important, but often supplementary, roles throughout the decision-making process and have influence on both the decision to adopt as well as on the mode of adoption. Furthermore, expected financial returns and concerns about operations and maintenance are the main determining factors for the mode of adoption. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",89,,498-505,Consumer behavior; Individual decision-making; Information channels; Leasing; Peer effects; Solar photovoltaic (PV); Costs; Decision making; Housing; Motivation; Photovoltaic effects; Solar concentrators; Individual decision making; Solar photovoltaics; Solar power generation; hardware; information system; maintenance; ownership; photovoltaic system; solar power; survey; technology adoption; California; United States,

Despite efforts to extend the national grid in rural areas, most remote areas will not be reached within the foreseeable future. Off-grid (decentralized) electricity grids are seen as a complement and forerunner to the national grid, making electricity available many years in advance and creating demand and a customer base. Renewable energy sources are plentiful in the region and may be particularly useful for off-grid systems. The countries' power sectors are undergoing interesting changes with potential to speed up the pace of RE. However, there are significant barriers to effective RE by grid-extension and off-grid installations. In this study, the specific drivers and barriers for RE in Mozambique and Tanzania are explored across a spectrum of involved actors. By qualitative methodology, drivers and barriers were first identified through literature survey, then data was collected both in semi-structured interviews carried out with power sector actors from national to local level and in visits to off-grid electricity users in Tanzania and Mozambique during eight weeks in 2010. Findings illustrate generic, country-specific, and renewable-energy-technology-specific drivers and barriers to grid and off-grid rural electrification, as perceived by different power sector actors. Results were validated and discussed with three external specialists. Drivers and barriers strongly relate to the roles of national and local actors in planning and implementation. The main drivers are political ambitions based on expected growth of demand, but bottom-up drivers such as local initiatives by industries or churches also exist. The barriers are related to lack of access to human capital, to difficulties in planning and donor dependency, to low rural markets and little interest from private sector, and to more straightforward technical matters such as difficulties with installing electric equipment in traditional buildings. Although off-grid systems and renewable energy sources are recognized by the actors, specific barriers to these systems are related to young organizations responsible for implementation and to guilt-by-association with dysfunctional diesel-based off-grid systems.",61,,117-124,Rural electrification; Off-grid systems; Renewable energy; Africa; Drivers and barriers,

While significant improvement in global sanitation has been realised, the sanitation situation in Africa is still appalling with almost 20% of the population reported to still practice open defecation in Sub Saharan Africa. The impacts of poor sanitation systems range from negatively impacting natural resources water quality, to causing health risks to the populations involved. Obviously, the current sanitation systems have gaps and can barely help the situation, which points to the necessity of a paradigm shift in the wastewater management to include interventions that would make proper sanitation achievable for all. Such interventions include decentralisation and resource recovery, which will not only produce environmentally acceptable effluents, but are also pertinent in achieving decreased costs for sanitation systems, hence making them more affordable. The decentralised system is cheaper than the centralised system, mainly due to decreased sewer needs and combining it with resource recovery. This provides an opportunity of decreasing costs further due to the several economic benefits attached to the recovered products. Whereas sanitation involves both wastewater and solid waste, this review paper discusses the current sanitation situation in Africa and proposes a wastewater management plan that could contribute to improvement for small agricultural communities. The plan encourages zero waste generation through decentralisation and recovery of water, energy and by-products such as nutrients and organics relevant to the local community. Apart from the proposed technological strategies, a winning sanitation management plan should also be appreciated and supported by all stakeholders, which can be achieved through proper communication and integration of local user needs.",15,3,465-478,sanitation; sustainability; waste management; waste utilization; wastewater; wastewater treatment; water quality; water reuse,

The production of biogas via anaerobic digestion of large quantities of agricultural residues, municipal wastes and industrial waste(water) would benefit African society by providing a clean fuel in the form of biogas from renewable feedstocks and help end energy poverty. Biogas technology can serve as a means to overcome energy poverty, which poses a constant barrier to economic development in Africa. Anaerobic digestion of the large quantities of municipal, industrial and agricultural solid waste in developing countries present environmental conditions that make use of anaerobic biotechnology extremely favourable under perspective of sustainable development. However, the use of biogas is not widespread in Africa. There are many reasons of economic, technical and non-technical nature for the marginal use of biogas in Africa. The key issue for biogas technology in Africa is to understand why large scale-up has not occurred despite demonstration by several programmes of the viability and effectiveness of biogas plants. This article provides knowledge-based review of biogas technology status, constraints and prospects in Africa. In addition, recommendations to overcome the technological and non-technological challenges to commercialise biogas are discussed. Recommendations for large scale adoption for biogas technology include establishing national institutional framework, increasing research and development, education and training and providing loans and subsidies and major policy shift in the energy sector. The conclusion is that biogas technology must be encouraged, promoted, invested, researched, demonstrated and implemented in Africa. ¬© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",8,2,187-200,Agricultural wastes; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas technology; Developing countries; Municipal wastes,

The model village concept aims at empowering communities to take charge of their health and take action for prevention and treatment of common diseases and health situations. A healthy village project promotes local actions by community members, mobilizing human and financial resources to build healthy environments and promote healthy behaviors. It covers topics such as water and sanitation drainage, waste management, housing quality, domestic and community hygiene, and provision of health services, providing extensive source materials for adaptation to local needs and conditions. Sustainable village is a model in which appropriate green technology and local resources are used to improve livelihoods by meeting basic needs and providing the opportunity for micro-business growth and development. The goals of Sustainable Villages are: promote economic growth; protect the environment; foster a strong community; and improve the quality of life. Eco-villages offers inspiring examples of how people and communities can live healthy, cooperative, genuinely happy and have meaningful lifestyles. Methodology: Innovative and exploratory approach of this research necessitates using of qualitative methodology. This research carried out in Karafs Village in Razan Township, Hamedan Province. Population of the research is rural students (male and female) in guidance school and high school. This was selected by total sampling method. Students asked to express their perceptions of a ""good village"". In other words, tell us what is a good village? For this purpose, ""essay writing"" is used as a technique for the method of constant comparative analysis that innovate Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss in relation to grounded theory. According to this theory the process of collecting and analyzing data encompasses three phases including open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. Afterwards, based on the result of qualitative stage a Likert questionnaire was designed with qualitative categories. Goals of this stage were access to perceptions of rural students about a ""good village"" related to the village they live in, namely Karefs. Finally, one-sample t-test was used for analyzing questionnaire data. Results: In the first stage of the research, 218 essays were obtained from students of Karafs Village. Writers of 108 essays (49.54%) were boys and 110 essays were (50.46%) girls. After three stages of data analysis including open coding, axial coding, and selective coding, 124 categories or characteristics of ""good village"" was identified. These characteristics in process of selective coding were classified in 18 general categories, detailed as follows: Job creation and Career Development (7 categories); Agriculture development (10 categories); Economic self-reliance (2 categories); Lifestyle (5 categories); quality of life (8 categories); Social capital (7 categories); Balanced urban-rural relations (8 categories); Lack of social problems (4 categories); Development of ICT (3 categories); Facilities and accessibility (15 categories); Modernity (9 categories); Environment (17 categories); Physical development (13 categories); Housing and architectural development (9 categories); Rural management (2 categories); Family cooperation (1 categories). Finally, result of second stage by questionnaire for assessing situation of Karafs in relation to student perceptions, show that in 3 categories including ""lifestyle"", ""social capital"" and ""family cooperation"" the average of answers is above median, and in all of oth r 15 categories this is less than median.",4,4,Pe749-Pe775,attitudes; case studies; rural development; rural settlement; students; villages,

This cross-sectional study uses data collected in 2016 from 499 households in rural Jharkhand to understand the constraints of latrine adoption and drivers of sanitation preferences (plans to adopt toilets and willingness to pay for toilets). Focusing on a region with a large tribal population, the study examines two types of predictors, namely structural factors (objective socioeconomic, sociocultural and ecological characteristics) and psychosocial drivers (perceived unaffordability of toilet, hygiene and sanitation knowledge, perceived health risks, attitudes, both descriptive and injunctive social norms, and perceived water stress). We find that structural constraints related to educational, economic and sociocultural inequalities predict toilet ownership. Low sanitation rates can neither be attributed to a lack of expressed demand nor lack of recognition of the disadvantages of open defecation. Similarly, variations in sanitation preferences are neither explained by differences in hygiene and sanitation knowledge nor by understandings of sanitation health risks. We find that perceived unaffordability, attitudes (perceived benefits of toilet and disadvantages of OD) and perceived descriptive social norms are of key importance. This implies a potential for persuasive strategies that manipulate social norms around sanitation, particularly if they simultaneously address perceptions around financial unaffordability of toilets and around the benefits of toilets. Importantly, however, attempts to change sanitation preferences by acting on forces of social (dis)approval (i.e. through perceived injunctive social norms) may be ineffective and generate negative unintended consequences.

However, the sustainability potential of solar cookers in developed economies has not been explored yet, which is the topic of this paper. Three types of solar cooker - box, panel and parabolic - were built as part of this research, using mostly (>70%) reused household materials. Their life cycle environmental and economic performance was analysed and compared to conventional microwaves. The results were first considered at the level of individual cookers and then scaled up to the levels of a city, region and country, considering a conservative (10%) uptake of solar cookers in substitution of microwaves. The contribution of home-made solar cookers to a circular economy and their social sustainability were also analysed. Spain was used as an illustrative example to demonstrate the potential sustainability benefits of using solar cookers in developed countries. The results suggest that, in comparison with microwaves, they could reduce annual life cycle costs by up to 40% and environmental impacts by up to 65%, including greenhouse gas emissions. At the national level, 42,600 t of CO2 eq. would be avoided annually while the consumption of primary energy would be reduced by 860 TJ. Furthermore, the electricity consumption would decrease by 67 GWh/yr and 4200 t/yr of household waste would be avoided. If solar cookers were built entirely by reusing household materials, up to Euro 23.2 million could be saved per year. Finally, the development of craft activities to build and repair the cookers can help people to engage socially and reduce stress, thus enhancing their social wellbeing. It can also increase people's awareness of a more sustainable use of resources. Therefore, home-made solar cookers represent a promising opportunity to motivate behavioural changes towards a circular economy and sustainability in developed countries.",648,,184-196,air pollution; assessment; consumption; costs; emissions; environmental impact; greenhouse gases; microwave radiation; refuse; stress; sustainability; uptake; wastes; wellness,

Inefficient use of fuel wood is considered one of the important causes of deforestation. Use of more efficient improved cookstoves is proposed as one of the measures that can reduce demand for fuel wood and charcoal and help in lowering the annoying deforestation rate in many developing countries. During the 1980s and 1990s several programs aiming at testing and disseminating energy saving technologies were implemented in Sudan. One of these technologies was improved cookstoves, which was intended to increase the efficiency of using energy from biomass sources. This study is carried out to examine the adoption rate and the factors affecting adoption of improved cookstoves in Khartoum State. The study is based on primary data collected through personal interviews with husbands and wives in 300 randomly selected households. Regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The results showed that the device's adoption rate was very low. The improved cookstove's relative advantage, housewife's exposure to messages about improved cookstoves, educational level of the housewife and the average educational level of the female household's members had significant positive effect on the household's innovativeness regarding adoption of improved cookstove. Wife's age and the educational level of the husband had negative significant effects. In the Sudanese patriarchal society all the household domestic tasks, particularly food preparation and related activities, are considered women's responsibilities and all the decisions related to them are taken by women. Therefore, these results could be understood as a reflection of the division of labor, gender relations and decision-making process in the Sudanese household.",307,43525,259–266,,

Household air pollution has been found to increase risk of pneumonia, especially due to exposure from dirty burning biomass fuels. It has been suggested that advanced stoves, which burn fuel more efficiently and reduce smoke emissions, may help to reduce household air pollution in poor, rural settings. This qualitative study aims to provide an insight into the household costs and perceived benefits from use of the stove in Malawi. It was conducted alongside The Cooking and Pneumonia Study (CAPS), the largest village cluster-level randomised controlled trial of an advanced combustion cookstove intervention to prevent pneumonia in children under five to date. In 2015, using 100 semi-structured interviews this study assessed household time use and perceptions of the stove from both control and intervention participants taking part in the CAPS trial in Chilumba. Household direct and indirect costs associated with the intervention were calculated. Users overwhelming liked using the stove. The main reported benefits were reduced cooking times and reduced fuel consumption. In most interviews, the health benefits were not initially identified as advantages of the stove, although when prompted, respondents stated that reduced smoke emissions contributed to a reduction in respiratory symptoms. The cost of the stove was much higher than most respondents said they would be willing to pay. The stoves were not primarily seen as health products. Perceptions of limited impact on health was subsequently supported by the CAPS trial data which showed no significant effect on pneumonia. While the findings are encouraging from the perspective of acceptability, without innovative financing mechanisms, general uptake and sustained use of the stove may not be possible in this setting. The findings also raise the question of whether the stoves should be marketed and championed as 'health interventions'.",183,,43739,air pollution; attitudes; beliefs; children; cooking; economics; finance; health; households; human diseases; mortality; pneumonia; pollution; randomized controlled trials; respiratory diseases; respiratory system; rural areas; social sciences; symptoms; villages; willingness to pay,

The World Health Organisation recommends scaling the adoption of clean fuels to improve maternal and child health. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) represents a scalable clean fuel that provides health and environmental benefits when used for household energy in LMICs. In Cameroon, over 70% of people rely on biomass for cooking, and the Government aims to increase LPG use from <20% to 58% by 2030. Supporting households make this transition requires involvement of multiple stakeholders and an understanding of perspectives from the community's perspective. We used visual participatory methods ‚ÄòPhotovoice' to explore households' perceptions of factors influencing the uptake of LPG for cooking in South-West Cameroon. Two groups of participants from rural (n = 7) and peri-urban (n = 8) areas photographed subjects they identified as preventing and facilitating LPG uptake in their communities. Subsequently, individual interviews (n = 15) and group discussions (n = 5) explored participants' reflections on the photographs. Thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo 10 software. The main barriers identified included difficulty in affording the initial LPG equipment and ongoing refills, scarcity of LPG retail shops and refills, and safety concerns. Facilitators included (i) increasing awareness of the benefits of LPG (e.g. health), (ii) increasing retail outlet density in rural areas, (iii) addressing safety concerns (e.g. replacing damaged cylinders), and (iv) reducing the price of LPG refills. Participants presented their photos at a public exhibition, which generated discussions with key stakeholders (e.g. government ministries) about how best to assist communities in this transition. Photovoice was found to be an innovative and effective approach for exploring how to advance equitable access to LPG from a community perspective and successfully engage with key stakeholders. ¬© 2019",228,,30-40,Adoption; Cameroon; Community-based participatory research; Cooking; Household air pollution; LPG; Photovoice; Qualitative research; liquefied petroleum gas; atmospheric pollution; child health; cooking appliance; health status; local participation; maternal health; participatory approach; photography; qualitative analysis; stakeholder; technology adoption; adult; aged; air pollution; Article; awareness; biomass; clean cooking; female; health promotion; household; human; male; methodology; participatory research; photovoice method; rural area; safety; stakeholder engagement; urban area,

Objective: We leveraged a national scale-up of Malawi's Learning and Innovation Population and Family Planning pilot to evaluate the effects of a scale-up of CBDs on contraceptive use. We also investigated whether education and income, two important determinants of contraceptive use behaviors, moderate the effects of the scaled-up CBDs. Method: We used the 2000/2004 and 2010/2016 Malawi Demographic and Health Surveys (N = 57,978) and difference-in-differences analyses to estimate the effects of the 2005 national scale-up of CBDs on modern contraceptive use. We used rural and urban communities as the intervention and comparison groups because the national CBDs were implemented only in rural communities. Contraceptive use is defined as the current use of any modern contraceptive method (e.g., pills) and was modelled using multilevel logistic regression. Results: Prior to the implementation of the national scale CBDs (2000/2004), the probability of using contraceptives was 21.5% in rural communities and 26.3% in urban communities. After the scale-up (2010/2016), the probability of using contraceptives increased in both rural and urban communities but was greater in rural communities (44.9% vs. 42.9%). The effect attributable to the national scale CBDs was 6.8 percentage points (95% CI [3.3, 9.7]). The effects of the national CBDs were greater among uneducated and low-income women. Conclusions: These findings suggest that national CBDs increase overall contraceptive use, particularly in rural communities, and that poor and uneducated women benefit more from family planning interventions that reduce communication and financial barriers. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",238,,,Community-based distribution; Contraceptive use; Family planning; Malawi; Malawi Demographic and Health Surveys; Rural; Scale-up; Sub-Saharan Africa; community development; demographic survey; educational attainment; health survey; low income population; service provision; womens status; adolescent; adult; Article; contraception; contraceptive behavior; demography; educational status; female; health care delivery; human; lowest income group; male; middle aged; population distribution; prediction; prevalence; rural area; scale up; social status; urban area,

This paper considers why a number of NGOs (Greenpeace, Oxfam, WWF, RSPB, Friends of the Earth) have chosen to enter the biofuels debate, and how they have variously developed policy, agreed a political campaign, and exercised political influence, in a key area of the world's response to major global climate change: how to reduce the carbon footprint of transport. We found that in many cases the development of NGO policy has been driven more by narrow political opportunities for influence than by broader and more coherent policy responses to global climate change or economic development, or indeed rigorous assessment of the scientific evidence. The research provides evidence of how NGO policies and lobbying significantly affected biofuel policy changes, review processes, target reductions, and sustainability regulation in the UK and in Europe. We consider that politically instituted markets, such as the one for biofuels, are examples of the emergence of new forms of governance of capitalist political economies facing a novel and pressing combination of drivers (climate change, energy security, resource constraints, and sustainable land-use). Politically instituted markets open up possibilities for political intervention from non-governmental or party-political actors, in ways that other markets do not. If political shaping of markets by NGOs becomes more widespread, issues of democratic legitimacy and public scrutiny will become ever more pressing. The paper is based on in-depth interviews with senior scientific directors and policy-makers in five NGOs, and of senior officials in UK government departments and the European Commission (DG Environment and DG Transport and Energy). It forms part of a wider ESRC research project in Brazil, the USA and Europe on the Transition to Sustainable Bioeconomies. ¬© Sociological Research Onlin, 1996-2010.",15,3,,Biofuels; Europe; Markets; NGO; Policy; Transport,

Water policies on the biomass production side should focus on ensuring efficient water use. While environmental policy instruments, such as command-and-control approaches, support maintaining specific water quantities and quality standards for biofuel production, market-based tools can help users identify least-cost options and increase efficiency. For the energy conversion side, water quality is the key issue that needs to be addressed with adequate policy instruments, but water scarcity can also constrain biofuel industry growth. It is important that policies and instruments for water management on the biomass production and energy conversion side are coordinated to ensure that efficiency is achieved along the entire production chain. Finally, the evaluation of water-use policies and instruments for bioenergy production should not only relate to their direct impacts on water use, but should also take into account overall impacts on the economy. This is of particular importance given the likely future large-scale expansion, the potentially large impacts on both water and land, and the potentially large benefits for rural economies of bioenergy expansion.",5,4,431-444,bioenergy; biofuels; biomass; biomass production; economic impact; energy conversion; environmental policy; regulations; reviews; rural economy; sustainability; water availability; water management; water policy; water quality; water use; water use efficiency,

It is therefore important to understand the common sources of cooking energy used by people in rural areas and the challenges faced in making fuel sources economically viable, socially acceptable and ecologically sustainable. In the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region, more than 90% of the population relies on firewood and charcoal (wood fuel, collectively) as a primary source of domestic energy. Wood fuel sustainability is challenged by unsustainable harvesting and inefficient methods of converting wood into energy. The use of inefficient cook stoves contributes to wood wastage and smoke exposure associated with severe illnesses. Households often abandon traditional nutritious diets that take a long time to cook, reduce the number of meals, and spend income on fuel at the expense of food costs. Innovations exist that have the potential to provide affordable and cleaner tree-based cooking fuel. Pruning trees on the farm as a fuel source brings firewood closer to women, lightens their workload, saves time and reduces income spent on cooking fuel. Using briquettes or gas cook stoves can reduce health risks associated with food preparation and reduce income spent on cooking fuel due to increased fuel efficiency. The development of these innovations indicates the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to increase awareness of the benefits of cooking fuel innovations, encourage further research on product quality enhancement and standardization, to understand cultural and behavioral issues influencing adoption, and integrate innovations into bioenergy policy frameworks.",19,1,14066-14087,agroforestry; bioenergy; biofuels; biomass; briquettes; charcoal; climate; climate change; diets; emissions; fuels; fuelwood; harvesting; health; households; income; innovations; nutrition; policy; poverty; pruning; renewable energy; rural areas; smoke; standardization; sustainability; women; wood,

More than a mere technical and economic challenge, these issues ask for a multidisciplinary approach that can connect energy production and energy consumption practices on different scales. This paper is an attempt to develop an approach to study energy transitions, based on the political ecology and energy practices literatures. The paper starts off from an empirical case study of a rural village Mae Kampong in Thailand. Rather than taking a high level approach, the starting points are the individual village history and its local energy practices. This village has moved stepwise from no access to electricity at all, to having its own micro-hydropower generators, and finally to a dual system of both hydropower and electricity from the national grid. By progressively contextualising these changes, a link can be made between the local energy trajectory and the shift to modern energy practices and the closing rural-urban divide; the marginalisation of micro-hydropower in Thailand; and debates about centralised versus decentralised forms of electricity production worldwide. This paper concludes that there is a need for more study on changing energy practices and politics on different scales. Furthermore, it highlights the role of the social sciences to develop novel methodologies to understand the complexities of the transition towards more sustainable energy systems.",20,3,280-293,case studies; electricity supplies; energy sources; hydroelectric schemes; methodology; modernization; politics; rural areas; rural development; water power,

Energetic agroecosystem productivity (energy contents of crops, livestock products, and wood per unit area) is compared to different types of energy inputs, i.e., external inputs from society (labor, industrial inputs, and external biomass inputs) and biomass reused from the local agroecosystem (feed, litter, and seeds). Energy transfers between different compartments of the agroecosystem (agricultural land, forest, and livestock) are also quantified. This allows for delineating an agroecosystem energy transition: In the first stage of this transition, i.e., in the nineteenth century, agroecosystem productivity was low (final produce ranged between 14 and 27 GJ/ha/yr), and local biomass reused made up 97% of total energy inputs in both regions (25-61 GJ/ha/yr). In this period, agroecosystem productivity increase was achieved primarily through more recycling of energy flows within the agroecosystems. In the second stage of the agroecosystem energy transition, i.e., after World War II, external energy inputs increased by factors 2.5 (Sankt Florian) and 5.0 (Grunburg), partly replacing local energy transfers. Final produce per area increased by factors 6.1 (Sankt Florian) and 2.9 (Grunburg). The difference in the resulting energy returns on investment (EROI) owes to regional specialization on cropping versus livestock rearing and to increasing market integration. Our results suggest that sustainable land-use intensification may benefit from some regional specialization harnessing local production potentials based on a mix of local and external inputs.",18,4,937-950,agricultural land; biomass; domestic animals; livestock; productivity,

This study uses methodologically consistent data on agroecosystem energy flows and different metrics of energetic efficiency from seven regional case studies in North America (USA and Canada) and Europe (Spain and Austria) to investigate energy transitions in Western agroecosystems from the late nineteenth to the late twentieth centuries. We quantify indicators such as external final energy return on investment (EFEROI, i.e., final produce per unit of external energy input), internal final EROI (IFEROI, final produce per unit of biomass reused locally), and final EROI (FEROI, final produce per unit of total inputs consumed). The transition is characterized by increasing final produce accompanied by increasing external energy inputs and stable local biomass reused. External inputs did not replace internal biomass reinvestments, but added to them. The results were declining EFEROI, stable or increasing IFEROI, and diverging trends in FEROI. The factors shaping agroecosystem energy profiles changed in the course of the transition: Under advanced organic and frontier agriculture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, population density and biogeographic conditions explained both agroecosystem productivity and energy inputs. In industrialized agroecosystems, biogeographic conditions and specific socio-economic factors influenced trends towards increased agroecosystem specialization.

While Africa remains the most 'underpowered' continent, the prognosis for a brighter future is looking good, as key stakeholders (governments, private sector, civil society, and the donor community) have mobilized at an unprecedented scale to experiment with new policies, regulatory frameworks, and business models to rapidly upscale access to sustainable energy. The top-down, central grid expansion approach to increasing electricity access is very capital intensive and yet has gained considerable momentum at the expense of lower cost options that utilize decentralized off-grid solutions. A decentralized bottom-up approach could also use indigenous renewable energy sources and foster more significant linkages with livelihood opportunities in the rural un-served territories.

Use of this renewable fuel in unvented cooking stoves results in disastrous consequences for human health and global warming. These negative outcomes have led governmental and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to push for improved wood-burning stoves and cleaner burning, but nonrenewable, alternatives like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The move up the energy ladder to cleaner fuels and improved stoves is thought to be associated with rising income and increased levels of urbanization. Increased income in developing countries often comes in the form of remittances from millions of migrants working abroad. Thus, migrants and their money could arguably be agents of change in the transition to cleaner fuels or the more efficient use of existing renewable energy sources. This article examines the case of Guatemala, where 88 percent of rural households use firewood for cooking, and where almost 15 percent of the country's 14 million population migrates to the United States. A continued preference for firewood, despite increased income, can be explained as a rational decision based on cost, experience, and cooking methods. Additionally, through an analysis of forest cover in firewood source areas, we demonstrate that this energy source is, for the most part, used in a fashion that makes it renewable. Recognizing these patterns of, and reasons for, this resource use permits us to make realistic recommendations for sustainable livelihoods and use of this renewable energy source.",101,4,918-928,biomass; burning; climate change; electricity; energy sources; fuelwood; global warming; improved wood; renewable energy; stoves; sustainability; urbanization,

In China, agricultural waste products, particularly manure from animal husbandry, represent a local source of rural energy, which can possibly be utilised through simple biogas digesters, thereby promoting rural development. For at least 50 years China has promoted this among farmers' not only with the goal of providing local clean energy for rural development, but also to improve health and reduce pressure on fuelwood. Until the early 2000s these policies failed or had limited impact, although substantial subsidy-based programmes in the past decade have led to considerable growth. However, our field trip interviews suggest that this growth hides deep-rooted problems. For biogas to fulfil its potential, it is crucial that the policy adapts to the changing realities of Chinese livestock production. Arguably, policies to promote rural biogas combine development goals with mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in a way that matches well with an SD-PAM mechanism. There are two main ways in which China could benefit from submitting its rural biogas policies to an SD-PAM-based regime. Such a biogas programme could get access to technology and funding for large-scale biogas systems and/or opportunities to sell credits. However, it would need to adapt to the international requirements and to accept international monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV). Alternatively, China could register its rural biogas programme as a unilateral SD-PAM, with less strict MRV requirements. This may win China recognition for its domestic policies, but would then not provide a mechanism for bringing international know how or possible financing to China.",4,3,199-209,agricultural wastes; animal manures; bioenergy; biogas; climate; digesters; emission; energy policy; energy sources; fuelwood; gas production; greenhouse gases; livestock farming; rural areas; rural development; sustainability; waste utilization; animal production,

Energy transition on national and European scales can be facilitated by expanding the capacity of pumped storage hydropower (PSHP) plants. Yet the extension of hydropower production, in particular PSHP, remains controversial, primarily due to environmental concerns. Focusing on 2 Alpine countries, Austria and Switzerland, this paper provides a system view of hydropower production and energy storage in the Alps. It discusses advantages and drawbacks of various assessment tools and identifies gaps and needs for the integrated assessment of PSHP plants. It concludes that instruments that evaluate the impacts and sustainability of PSHP projects need to be developed, elaborated, and applied in a participatory manner, in order to promote public dialogue, increase social acceptance, and, ideally, encourage energy consumers to become advocates of a sustainable energy future.",36,2,222-232,Alps; electricity; electricity generation; electricity generators; sustainability; water power,

Large coal gasification systems employ high pressure reactors along with gas treatment to enable the gas to be used in combined cycle mode with gas turbines and heat recovery steam generators. A review of the international experience suggests that these are very expensive in the Indian context and have not found their way despite many efforts over the last three decades. Alternative strategies involving flameless combustion/gasification at medium power levels (10-50 MWe) needing development are discussed here. Biomass wastes form a large sector for utilization and by the nature of their properties and availability are most suited for small power generation (a few thousand kg/h or equivalently a few MWe). All solid biomass waste is expected to be processed to eliminate extra organic material (sand, grit, etc.) and brought to regular shape, size and high density (700 to 1000 kg/m3) to facilitate thermal conversion process in fixed bed high temperature reactor at moderate oxidant (air) fluxes to produce combustible gas having CO, H2, CH4 and inerts. The gas is cooled (usually) and cleaned of particulate matter and any sulphur-related compounds before being used for heat or electricity generation. Fuel-to-electricity conversion efficiencies of 27% to 30% for small power and up to 35% at medium power levels can be achieved. The strategy allows the lowest possible emissions with unit investment costs comparable to large power systems.

In the case of consumer subsidies provided mostly in developing countries, these subsidies are often intended as measures to alleviate poverty. In practice, however, they frequently miss that objective, with benefits largely reaped by higher income groups who can afford motor vehicles and electrical goods. Better-designed and targeted policies can achieve poverty reduction far more cost-effectively. Moreover, reducing the burden of subsidies from the public purse would help relieve fiscal debt during a time of economic recession; free up government resources for other priorities such as education and healthcare; and contribute towards addressing climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing investment barriers for clean and renewable energy technologies and resources. This report looks at three cases where governments - Ghana, France and Senegal - have undertaken fossil-fuel subsidy reform with varying degrees of success. While the specific circumstances of each country is unique, there appear to be elements of successful reform strategies that are consistent across different types of subsidies, fuels and countries. Drawing from these three case studies, this report describes how effective strategies are based on: • a deep understanding of the subsidy, its original objectives, the rationale for reform and the likely impacts; • establishing clear objectives and parameters for reform; • building support by communicating the benefits of reform and consulting stakeholders; • policy measures to reduce negative impacts on affected groups; • ongoing monitoring, and evaluation of reform and the flexibility to adjust policies in changing circumstances; and, • independent pricing mechanisms to prevent the government being drawn back in to subsidization.",,,1-41,,

METHODS - : The Acute Stroke Program of Interventions Addressing Racial and Ethnic Disparities (ASPIRE) project is a multilevel program using a community-engaged approach to stroke preparedness targeted to underserved black communities in the District of Columbia. This intervention aimed to decrease acute stroke presentation times and increase intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator utilization for acute ischemic stroke. RESULTS - : Phase 1 included (1) enhancement of focus of emergency medical services on acute stroke; (2) hospital collaborations to implement and enrich acute stroke protocols and transition District of Columbia hospitals toward primary stroke center certification; and (3) preintervention acute stroke patient data collection in all 7 acute care District of Columbia hospitals. A community advisory committee, focus groups, and surveys identified perceptions of barriers to emergency stroke care. Phase 2 included a pilot intervention and subsequent citywide intervention rollout. A total of 531 community interventions were conducted, reaching >10 256 participants; 3289 intervention evaluations were performed, and 19 000 preparedness bracelets and 14 000 stroke warning magnets were distributed. Phase 3 included an evaluation of emergency medical services and hospital processes for acute stroke care and a year-long postintervention acute stroke data collection period to assess changes in intravenous tissue-type plasminogen utilization. CONCLUSIONS - : We report the methods, feasibility, and preintervention data collection efforts of the ASPIRE intervention. ¬© 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",45,7,2047-2052,"prevention & control; residence characteristics; stroke; tissue plasminogen activator; adult; article; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; community care; community program; demography; emergency care; emergency health service; emergency ward; feasibility study; female; health economics; health program; human; International Classification of Diseases; major clinical study; male; national health organization; priority journal; race difference; social status; United States; African Americans; Aged; Clinical Trials as Topic; Community-Based Participatory Research; District of Columbia; Emergency Medical Services; Feasibility Studies; Hospitals, Urban; Humans; Middle Aged; Patient Education as Topic; Pilot Projects; Program Development; Quality Assurance, Health Care",

In many countries of Europe, the awareness of the importance of forest biomass as fuel has been closely connected to the general understanding and the realization of own and world energetic situation. Forest biomass represents an important source of energy, whose use should be paid more attention to in the future. In its traditional forms, biomass is still a very significant source of energy in most countries of the southeast Europe and it will continue to be so in the near future. However, it is more and more used not just for thermal energy production, but also for the production of electric and cooling energy which is considered as an important part of the energetic transition which is a promising model with high economic and ecological advantages. The use of biomass energy offers significant possibilities for opening new jobs, thus having a significant positive impact on the local and national economy. This paper describes the present stage of the energetic transition in the south-eastern European countries and the role of forest biomass in its implementation. Examples and events in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Kosovo and Serbia are analysed. Rural development projects as well as the use of bioenergy biomass has a great potential for income generation, increase of productivity and opening of small village companies. From the macroeconomic perspective, the use of biomass contributes to all the important elements in the development of the south-eastern European countries. Key drivers as well as the obstacles which can be encountered in the energetic transition in local government units can be structured as follows; potential stimulus, refers to the most south-eastern European countries regarding their significant afforestation and forest biomass potential, market stimulus due to cost-effective accessible plants and equipment for biomass, as well as the adequate support of manufacturing firms, the use of commercial and business connections: where most of biomass trades among the south-eastern European countries and EU is carried out in integration with the forest product trade, to be first or the local pride, is an important driver in the south-eastern European countries to keep money at home is another important link with the positive perception in the use of the forest biomass. The paper recognised a significant number of potential groups of obstacles for using the forest biomass; economic limitations more favourable price of the forest biomass energy in relation to fossil fuels, financial limitations as a serious obstacle for each form of the renewable energy, social limitations are very specific for each form of the renewable energy, human resource limitations since most local governments do not have sufficient human potential, limitations due to transparency are a very frequent problem, primarily depends on the democratic power, technical limitations mostly belong to the fact that most of the equipment for using renewable energy sources and the increase in energetic efficiency from the import, has not been produced on the local level.",139,43810,561-569,Bioenergy; Energy transition; People; Socio-economic drivers; South-east Europe; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Economics; Forestry; International trade; Reforestation; Regional planning; Renewable energy resources; Bio-energy; Energy transitions; Socio-economics; South East Europe; Biomass; alternative energy; biomass power; energy efficiency; energy resource; renewable resource; rural development; socioeconomic impact; Albania; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Croatia; Kosovo; Macedonia [Southern Europe]; Serbia,

Although dependent on market demand and economic feasibility in relation to non-renewable energy sources, renewable energy sources can and must be exploited in a better and more effective way. The use of wood pellets as fuel for domestic stoves and boilers and for cofiring in thermal power plants has been an amazing success story over the past 20 years. Socio-economic impact studies are commonly used to evaluate the local, regional and/or national implications of implementing particular development decisions. Typically, these impacts are measured in terms of economic variables, such as employment, revenue and taxes, but a complete analysis must also include social, cultural and environmental issues. In many ways the social implications arising from local pellets production or any bioenergy activity represents the less clear and concrete end of impact studies; nevertheless they can be broken down into two categories: those relating to an increased standard of living and those that contribute to increased social cohesion and stability. The primary instruments for the development of renewable energy technologies across the world are international carbon reduction policy drivers. But the development of one type of technology over another on national, regional or local level is often a function of the intricate balance of socio-economic factors in that particular geographical location. The development of wood pellet markets has been very strong in some coutries and almost non-existent in others. Based on these considerations, this paper is primarily focused on investigating the critical socio-economic factors in developing national pellet markets. Examples from Austria, Ireland and Croatia highlight some of the key factors that influenced the development and pellet market situation in these countries. Based on initial review, current situation and analysis of these markets, this paper defines critical factors that influence development of national pellet market. Critical socio-economic factors for the development of national pellet market resulting from presented analysis are the following: ‚Ä¢ Financial incentives for investing in wood pellet heating rapidly increase uptake even when pellets are competitive with alternative fuels; ‚Ä¢ The existence of a strong sawmilling industry to provide, at least initially, a low cost and readily available source of raw material; ‚Ä¢ Stringent quality and sustainability requirements for pellet boilers with regard to emissions, efficiency and security - poor products can permanently damage the market, trigger serious environmental concerns and cause major functional problems; ‚Ä¢ Establishment of effective quality control mechanisms for wood pellets. Establishment of national or international tracking systems that allow identification of the origin of pellets; ‚Ä¢ Dedicated educational programs and certification of installers establishing pellet heating systems.; ‚Ä¢ Linking of subsidies with quality requirements for boilers and certification of installers; ‚Ä¢ Procurement of wood pellet heating in public buildings to provide user confidence and to stimulate the supply chain; ‚Ä¢ Development of incentives for energy service companies to enter into the biomass heating market. In conclusion, looking at the overall situation regarding pellets production and utilisation a strong growth can be expected with political support at the EU level, playing a major role for the extension of the pellet industry into new member states in particular. The ambitious EU target of achieving 20 % of energy supply from renewable energy by the end of 2020 is impossible without dedicated policies to develop renewable heating. In addition, the on-going oil price rally and carbon dioxide reduction targets also encourage the expansion of the markets for pellets.",135,43621,281-289,Market; Pellets; Renewable energy sources; Socio-economic factors; Austria; Bio-energy; Broken down; Carbon dioxide reduction; Carbon reduction; Co-firing; Control mechanism; Critical factors; Croatia; Current situation; Economic feasibilities; Economic variables; Educational program; Energy service company; Energy supplies; Environmental concerns; Environmental issues; Financial incentives; Functional problems; Geographical locations; Impact study; Ireland; Key factors; Low costs; Market demand; Market situation; New Member States; Non-renewable energy sources; Oil Prices; Organic materials; Pellet boiler; Pellet heating systems; Pellets production; Political support; Public buildings; Quality requirements; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Renewable energy technologies; Renewable heating; Sawmilling; Social cohesion; Social implication; Socio-economic factor; Socio-economic impacts; Standard of living; Strong growth; Thermal power plants; Tracking system; Type of technology; Wood pellet; Wood processing; Wood residues; Alternative fuels; Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Economic analysis; Energy policy; Forestry; Heating; Industry; Natural resources; Ore pellets; Pelletizing; Pollution control; Public works; Quality control; Renewable energy resources; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Thermoelectric power plants; Wood; Wood fuels; Economic and social effects; bioenergy; decision making; emission; environmental issue; European Union; feasibility study; geographical region; industrial development; market system; policy making; renewable resource; socioeconomic impact; stabilization; sustainability; taxonomy; Biomass; Employment; Market Research; Raw Materials; Renewable Resources; Sustainable Forest Management; Wood Waste; Australia; Europe,

This systematic literature review (n = 81) aims to identify the main drivers and barriers to clean cooking from a consumer perspective. In addition, it aims to define how consumers perceive ICS with respect to traditional stoves. Thematic analysis revealed seven factors that may act as drivers or barriers to ICS adoption: economic factors; socio-demographics; fuel availability; attitude toward technology; awareness of the risks of traditional cookstoves and the benefits of ICS; location; and social and cultural influences. Perceptions focused on four topics: convenience and uses, aesthetics, health-related impacts, and environmental impacts. This review contributes to understanding of consumer behavior with regards to ICS. The findings suggest that availability and affordability of technology are not enough to enhance ICS adoption.

The paper highlights the paradoxes of oil-rich Nigeria and the stark reality of social infrastructure deprivations in that country. Perennial power outages over many years have translated to the absence of or poorly-developed basic social infrastructures in Nigeria. The consequences of this lack have been an increase in abject poverty in rural and urban communities as well as the erosion of social order and threats to citizen and their property. This paper proposes the adaptation of two emerging technologies for building sustainable energy systems and the development of decentralized and sustainable energy sources as catalyst for much-needed social infrastructure development through the creation of Renewable Energy Business Incubators, creative lending strategies, NGO partnerships and shifting energy-distribution responsibilities. These changes will stimulate grassroots economies in the country, develop large quantities of much needed clean water, maintain acceptable standards of sanitation and improve the health and wellbeing of Nigerian communities. The proposed strategies are specific to the Nigerian context; however, the authors suggest that the same or similar strategies may provide energy and social infrastructure development solutions to other developing countries as well.",2,6,1558-1570,biomass; energy sources; renewable energy; renewable resources; rural areas; sanitation; sustainability; technology; urban areas,

These disparities reflect both technical and economic factors, as well as the social, political, and ecological gaps between how communities see energy development and national/global policy goals. Known as the ""local-national gap"", many nations struggle with fostering meaningful conversations about the role of alternative energy technologies within communities. Mitigation of this problem first requires understanding the distribution of existing alternative energy technologies at the local level of policymaking. To address the limitation of existing adoption trend analysis at the scale of local governance (e.g., county governments), this paper demonstrates a novel method for contextualizing solar technology adoption by using the State of Georgia in the United States as an exemplar. Leveraging existing work on the Gini Coefficient as a metric for measuring energy inequity, we argue these tools can be applied to analyze where gaps exist in ongoing solar adoption trends. As we demonstrate, communities that adopt solar tend to be concentrated in a few counties, indicating existing conversations are limited to a circumscribed set of social networks. This information and the model we demonstrate can enable focused qualitative analyses of existing solar trends, not only among high-adoption areas but within communities where little to no adoption has occurred.",10,11,,technology adoption; Lorenz curves; Gini coefficient; local-national; gap; Georgia; NIMBY; solar energy; community development; soft cost; reduction; SOCIOTECHNICAL IMAGINARIES; ENERGY; ACCEPTANCE; GINI; INNOVATION; BARRIERS; SYSTEMS; SCALE,

Despite the enormous amount of palm biomass in the state, the use of biomass as fuel for power generation remains low. This study is designed to investigate the sustainability of power generation from palm biomass specifically in Sarawak by conducting a survey among the palm oil mill developers. To conduct this investigation, several key sustainability factors were identified: the security of the biomass supply, the efficiency of conversion technology, the existing network system, challenges and future prospects for power generation from palm biomass. These factors were assessed through a set of questionnaires. The returned questionnaires were then analysed using statistical tools. The results of this study demonstrate that Sarawak has biomass in abundance, and that it is ready to be exploited for large scale power generation. The key challenge to achieving the renewable energy target is the inadequate grid infrastructure that inhibits palm oil developers from benefiting from the Feed-in-Tariff payment scheme. One way forward, a strategic partnership between government and industrial players, offers a promising outcome, depending on an economic feasibility study.

This SDG6 aims to provide adequate improved sanitation facilities to over 2.3 billion people around the world who have no or limited access to sanitation, wherein more than two-thirds of these un-served people live in rural areas. One of the strategies for addressing this global issue is through emerging sustainable sanitation technologies such as the Eco-Toilet System (ETS), which uses small amounts of water or is even waterless and recovers nutrients from human waste thereby promoting water-energy conservation, improved sanitation and supplement nutrients essential to plant growth. Social acceptance, however, remains a key barrier in deploying the ETS. A social perception study on the use of the ETS was conducted in a rural community in Mulanay, Philippines. The researchers analyzed the proposed combined technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior (C-TAM-TPB) using multiple linear regression and the Mann-Whitney U-test to evaluate the perceptions and attitudes of a rural community towards the use of the ETS. The results showed that more than 50% of the respondents are aware of the nutrient value of human excreta and believe that it is usable as fertilizer; however, less than 25% prefer to utilize it for food production. Results also indicate that the behavior of the users is driven by their attitude ( beta =0.420, p-value <0.010).

We found that disruptive changes have affected the electrification policies in Ecuador during decades of avoiding the development of strengthened institutions. Despite this major drawback, we found that there is a consensus on granting access to energy for all. This partially explains the national efforts, persistent through different administrations to fund rural electrification. However, in the case of off-grid photovoltaic solutions, these efforts have consistently neglected allocating funds for operation and maintenance, which has seriously compromised the sustainability. Moreover, although Ecuadorian officials declared to favor stand-alone photovoltaic systems in the case of indigenous communities in the Amazon, we found that environmental or socio-cultural aspects have a minor role in the selection of these systems.

To achieve sustainable energy systems, such concerns should be taken into account in the development of smart grid technologies. In this paper, we show that many concerns are related to moral values such as privacy, justice, or trust. We explore the effect of moral values on the acceptance of smart grid technologies.

This study reviews the adoption of disruptive technologies in real estate. It covers the applications of nine such technologies, hereby referred to as the Big9. These are: drones, the internet of things (IoT), clouds, software as a service (SaaS), big data, 3D scanning, wearable technologies, virtual and augmented realities (VR and AR), and artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. The Big9 are examined in terms of their application to real estate and how they can furnish consumers with the kind of information that can avert regrets. The review is based on 213 published articles. The compiled results show the state of each technology's practice and usage in real estate. This review also surveys dissemination mechanisms, including smartphone technology, websites and social media-based online platforms, as well as the core components of SRE: sustainability, innovative technology and user centredness. It identifies four key real estate stakeholders-consumers, agents and associations, government and regulatory authorities, and complementary industries-and their needs, such as buying or selling property, profits, taxes, business and/or other factors. Interactions between these stakeholders are highlighted, and the specific needs that various technologies address are tabulated in the form of a what, who and how analysis to highlight the impact that the technologies have on key stakeholders. Finally, stakeholder needs as identified in the previous steps are matched theoretically with six extensions of the traditionally accepted technology adoption model (TAM), paving the way for a smoother transition to technology-based benefits for consumers. The findings pertinent to the Big9 technologies in the form of opportunities, potential losses and exploitation levels (OPLEL) analyses highlight the potential utilisation of each technology for addressing consumers' needs and minimizing their regrets. Additionally, the tabulated findings in the form of what, how and who links the Big9 technologies to core consumers' needs and provides a list of resources needed to ensure proper information dissemination to the stakeholders. Such high-quality information can bridge the gap between real estate consumers and other stakeholders and raise the state of the industry to a level where its consumers have fewer or no regrets.

Although 'community renewable energy' emerged as a grassroots-based innovation and is thus of increasing interest to the public and politicians, actual interwoven community benefits and challenges of renewable-energy projects are not well understood yet. Recent studies mainly consider potential community benefits and not experienced benefits and hardly address challenges which affected communities face. To address this research gap, we empirically investigated how people perceive community-based renewables and assess the change in the social fabric of communities, the so named 'community transition' resulting as outcome of local energy transition. We explored trade-offs between benefits and challenges by conducting a regional literature analysis, two sets of interviews in municipalities of North Frisia (Germany) and a household survey in one of them. Our results lead to two important insights: First, community renewables provide interwoven and offsetting physical, environmental, social, economic, planning and political benefits and challenges for communities. Second, a local participatory process and a fair distribution of revenues are essential for the success of community benefits, holding the potential for a sustainable development in rural areas. Thus, multifaceted and interlinked local benefits but also challenges of local energy transition need to be addressed more by developers and political decision-makers in order to enable and retain positive, sustainable outcomes of community renewable-energy projects.",12,4,563-578,attitudes; community involvement; constraints; participation; projects; renewable energy; rural development; social change; socioeconomics; sustainability,

In cities worldwide, energy conservation initiatives have been realized that demonstrate the social, financial, and environmental benefits that energy conservation can generate. However, in order to accomplish international goals pertaining to climate mitigation, these initiatives need to go to scale and reach a greater and broader audience. To accelerate the scaling-up of such initiatives, an in-depth understanding of barriers hampering this process and local strategies that can be applied to address these barriers is required. While scholars and practitioners underline the importance of local solutions to the global problem of climate change, little is known about strategies that can be applied at the local level to overcome barriers. This paper has three general findings that can make a valuable contribution to theory and practice on urban climate governance. First, it sketches the context-specificity of barriers to scaling-up energy conservation initiatives and reflects on similarities and differences in barriers to energy conservation in residential and commercial building stocks in two European cities: Utrecht and Valencia. Second, this paper presents several local strategies that can be applied to overcome barriers, thereby improving our understanding of the relation between barriers and solutions. Finally, the findings of the paper suggest that while many barriers have national or international origins, the local environment appears to be a promising scale to address barriers.

Building residential energy installations requires resources (expertise, time, financial liquidity, space) not all citizens have at hand. Especially in urban areas, where land is scarce and many people live as tenants, only a minority qualifies. To include urban households in the energy transition, new smart and efficient solutions need to be developed. In this article, we examine an example of an innovative energy project in Zurich (Switzerland) that complements the concept of community energy, offering residents a simple and cost-effective way to participate in photovoltaic installations in their city. The aim of the study is to gain understanding of the project characteristics that trigger or hinder participation, drawing on qualitative data from semi-structured telephone interviews with participants and non-participants (n = 18). The main drivers for participation are the direct and tangible way of supporting local sustainable energy generation, and the desire to feel as a co-owner at little effort and expense. Conversely, reservations against photovoltaics and a lack of financial resources, knowledge, or interest act as barriers for participation. The study lays a foundation for further quantitative examination and for the development of other urban energy projects. ¬© 2017 The Authors",37,,420-426,Community energy; Participation; Photovoltaic; Renewable energy; Urban energy project; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Renewable energy resources; Renewable energies; Urban energy; Energy policy,

The paper is based on interviews and workshops with inhabitants in two case sites as well as city stakeholders. In both cities the official discourse is the development and extension of universal conventional centralised water systems. However these are malfunctioning systems co-existing with various decentralised household water management practices. One challenge is how to complement the resource-intensive modern infrastructure ideal with low-technology, green infrastructure-based approaches. Another is how to change the discursive framings of existing decentralised practices from disqualification as ‚Äòrural' practices unfit for the urban. Finally, as developing cities purse sustainable development goals it is necessary to strengthen the ability of the urban water regime to support co-production and decentralised water management activities whilst reconfiguring those elements of practices that are inherently unsustainable. ¬© 2019",48,,,African cities; Coexistence; Coproduction; Social practices; Sustainable urban water management; Water management practices; Co-production; Management practices; Urban water management; Water management,

The key technical and economic factors that affected the competitiveness of these CCGT units were evaluated. The results showed that advanced H-class CCGT technology has the lowest LCOE for the base case scenario at 4.93 US cents/kW h versus 5.32 and 5.71 US cents/kW h for F- and E-class technologies respectively. It is evident that the more advanced CCGT technology matches the major market drivers for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) energy transition, namely; competitive lifecycle costs, high thermal efficiencies which reduce fuel costs and limit CO2 emissions and a high operational flexibility. The LCOE model outputs summarise the overall financial competitiveness of the different CCGT technologies for the UAE up to the year 2030 considering the future power generation demand profile. There are no H-class gas turbines installed in the UAE and this was one of the drivers behind this paper to show the benefits of the latest advanced CCGT technology. The study conveniently facilitates future discussions on the opportunities and challenges of the UAE's energy transition for developers, electricity suppliers and national policy makers. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",19,,160-172,Combined Cycle Gas Turbine; Emissions; Levelised cost of electricity; Power generation; UAE; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Competition; Costs; Electric utilities; Engineering education; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Particulate emissions; Power markets; Cost of electricity; Energy transitions; Financial competitiveness; New electricity market; Operational flexibility; Techno-economic assessment; United Arab Emirates; Combined cycle power plants; assessment method; carbon emission; electricity supply; turbine,

By drawing on the literature on the transition to electric cooking in South Africa and more broadly, literature from across the Global South analysing the uptake of ICS (improved cookstoves), LPG (liquid petroleum gas) and solar home systems, this study identifies the factors (e.g. successful delivery models and marketing strategies) that have enabled these innovations to reach scale. This knowledge is then related to the eCook concept, by identifying the potential users of this promising technology and outlining potential marketing strategies, as well as a user-focused iterative design process, that will enable social enterprises to reach them. Uptake is predicted to be most rapid in hot climates where fuelwood/charcoal is purchased and low energy diets and low power cooking devices are the standard. Mobile enabled fee-for-service (utility) business models, the establishment of a service network, awareness raising campaigns on the benefits of clean cooking, female-focussed training programmes and bundling eCook systems with locally appropriate appliances to enable productive activities are seen as key to reaching scale.",22,,106-115,Cook; Solar; Behaviour; Electric; Battery,

Technological innovations, institutional reforms, and change in social practices are some of the means of eco-innovation. As a result, there is a wide discourse on the many dimensions of eco-innovation since the dawn of the millennium. However, the concept of eco-innovation lacks theoretical consistency; hence, it has remained narrow and disintegrated. Therefore, this study conducts a systematic review of the articles focusing on the significance of theories in relation to the process of eco-innovation, in order to investigate the evolving theories of eco-innovation, highlight the existing research gaps, and to identify directions for potential theoretical development that would be valuable for a deeper system change. The findings show resource-based view, institutional theory, stakeholders theory, and evolutionary theory to be the most commonly used theories, along with identification of material-based enterprises as the primary sectors of implementation exhibiting a strong technological bias. The findings indicate that eco-innovations are primarily perceived from a narrow set of neo-liberal notions that although is effective for incremental improvements, lack credibility for defining the differentiated approach associated with radical eco-innovations. Accordingly, selective pressure by means of policy making process, design dynamic, and societal demand are identified as gray areas requiring greater theoretical attention. An analytical framework built on technological, institutional, organizational and social ecoinnovation is represented for exploring the research areas of system change, economic sustainability, product network sustainability, and socio-technical landscape, that facilitates sustainability transition.

V.",Access barriers to obstetric care at health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa-a systematic review,Systematic Reviews,,10.1186/s13643-017-0503-x,,"Background: Since 2000, the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals, which included a goal to improve maternal health by the end of 2015, has facilitated significant reductions in maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, despite more focused efforts made especially by low-and middle-income countries, targets were largely unmet in sub-Saharan Africa, where women are plagued by many challenges in seeking obstetric care. The aim of this review was to synthesise literature on barriers to obstetric care at health institutions in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: This review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Scopus databases were electronically searched to identify studies on barriers to health facility-based obstetric care in sub-Saharan Africa, in English, and dated between 2000 and 2015. Combinations of search terms 'obstetric care', 'access', 'barriers', 'developing countries' and 'sub-Saharan Africa' were used to locate articles. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies were considered. A narrative synthesis approach was employed to synthesise the evidence and explore relationships between included studies. Results: One hundred and sixty articles met the inclusion criteria. Currently, obstetric care access is hindered by several demand-and supply-side barriers. The principal demand-side barriers identified were limited household resources/income, non-availability of means of transportation, indirect transport costs, a lack of information on health care services/providers, issues related to stigma and women's self-esteem/assertiveness, a lack of birth preparation, cultural beliefs/practices and ignorance about required obstetric health services. On the supply-side, the most significant barriers were cost of services, physical distance between health facilities and service users' residence, long waiting times at health facilities, poor staff knowledge and skills, poor referral practices and poor staff interpersonal relationships. Conclusion: Despite similarities in obstetric care barriers across sub-Saharan Africa, country-specific strategies are required to tackle the challenges mentioned. Governments need to develop strategies to improve healthcare systems and overall socioeconomic status of women, in order to tackle supply-and demand-side access barriers to obstetric care. It is also important that strategies adopted are supported by research evidence appropriate for local conditions. Finally, more research is needed, particularly, with regard to supply-side interventions that may improve the obstetric care experience of pregnant women.

We study four technological routes that the ""Platform Sustainable Mobility"" has selected for this goal: (1) hybridization of vehicles, (2) liquid biofuels, (3) natural gas as a transportation fuel and (4) hydrogen as a transportation fuel. These technological routes all envision large-scale changes in vehicle propulsion technology and fuel infrastructure. Furthermore, they compete for the scarce resources available to invest in new (fuel) infrastructures, which implicates that these 'transition paths' are also interdependent at the level of the mobility system. The main outcome of the analysis is the identification of barriers that are currently blocking the transition toward sustainable mobility. Barriers are classified as being related to (1) technology and vehicle development, (2) the availability of (fuel) infrastructures, and (3) elements of the institutional infrastructure. The transition management framework currently misses guidelines for coping with (competing) technologies that each require large infrastructural investments. We further argue that avoiding undesired lock-ins and creating a beneficial institutional context for sustainable mobility cannot be pursued at the transition path level. Therefore, we recommend that a more systemic approach should be taken to the transition to sustainable mobility, in which the interdependencies between the transition paths are critically assessed and in which the possibilities to legitimize sustainable mobility as a whole should be used. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Inc.",77,8,1260-1269,Barriers; Innovation; Sustainable Mobility; Transition management; In-vehicle; Liquid biofuels; Mobility systems; Netherlands; Scarce resources; Sustainable transportation systems; Systemic approach; Technological route; Transition paths; Transportation fuels; Vehicle development; Fuels; Investments; Transportation routes; Natural gas transportation; fuel consumption; hydrogen; mobility; resource scarcity; sustainable development; technological change; technological development; transportation policy; transportation system,

Off-grid technologies, such as electric mini-grids are seen as appropriate solutions. However, their diffusion rate in developing countries is not sufficient to reach poverty reduction targets. In this paper we analyze the case of remote electric mini-grids in Laos, a least-developed country characterized by many barriers to the diffusion of modern technology. We apply the Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) approach in order to derive policy recommendations on how to increase the diffusion rate. As the TIS framework has hardly been applied to such challenging contexts, we also aim to produce insights for the theoretical advancement of the TIS literature. Our analysis, which draws from secondary and primary data collected through field work, points to two systemic root causes for the low diffusion rate: institutional mismatches within and across geographical levels as well as hampered flows of resources across these levels. Based on these findings we derive policy recommendations proposing to formulate a national technology-specific electrification strategy. In terms of insights for the TIS community, we suggest to strengthen the role of culture in empirical TIS analyses and to extend the definition of one specific TIS function. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The complex, established Legacy sectors' that resist change, particularly disruptive innovation, share common features that obstruct the market launch of innovations, over and above the valley of death' and other obstacles that have been the traditional focus of innovation policy. Innovations in Legacy sectors must penetrate a well-established and well-defended technological/economic/political/social paradigm that favours existing technology, characterised by (1) perverse' subsidies and price structures that create a mismatch between the incentives of producers and broader social goals, such as environmental sustainability, public health and safety, and geopolitical security; (2) established infrastructure and institutional architecture that imposes regulatory hurdles or other disadvantages to new entrants (3) market imperfections beyond those faced by other innovations: network economies, lumpiness, economies of scale, split incentives, needs for collective action, and transaction costs (4) politically powerful vested interests, reinforced by public support, that defend the paradigm and resist innovations that threaten their business models (5) public habits and expectations attuned to existing technology and (6) an established knowledge and human resources structure adapted to its needs. Beyond these obstacles, more socially desirable technologies that are driven by environmental or other non-market considerations must overcome the lack of agreed replacement standards against which putative alternatives can be judged. We have developed a new, integrative analytic framework for categorising the obstacles to market launch faced by Legacy sectors, and earlier applied this method to energy, health delivery, the long-distance electric grid, building, and air transport. In energy especially, the requirement for innovation is sufficiently urgent that large-scale domestic and collaborative international research should take place even at the cost of possible competitive disadvantage and even if it is some time before the USA adopts carbon charges and thereby puts pressure on the prevailing paradigm of fossil fuel use. We now extend this method to sustainable agriculture. American paradigms in agriculture and in energy are exported worldwide, delaying the development and spread of needed innovations that are not consistent with them. Foreign manufacturers wishing to enter US markets must suit their products in these sectors to American paradigms, while American exports of technology may be insufficiently cost conscious or respectful of environmental sustainability. Developing countries are technology takers and suffer from asymmetric innovative capability. They need to choose sources of technology best suited to their situation.

This study used survey data to describe the socioeconomic and technological level of peanut farmers in major peanut-producing areas in the country, and determine the adoption factors and constraints for selected technologies. A total of 296 farmers in 10 provinces were interviewed in 2015. The binary logit model was applied to explore the farm-level factors affecting the adoption of selected technologies (seed inoculant, seed treatment, chemical fertilizer and pesticides) for peanut farming. Results indicate that decision factors vary per technology but relatively consistent drivers to technology adoption are farmer gender, attendance to seminar or training in peanut production, availability of irrigation source, and membership in organization. Household size was an adoption constraint in select technologies. Technology uptake was also influenced by regional differences. Implications are increased provision of seminars and trainings for peanut farmers; facilitation of farmers' organizations; support by local government units (LGUs) in technology promotion, and ensuring adequate irrigation. Informing decision makers on the factors and constraints to adoption of these technologies will largely make for evidence-based policymaking. The adoption of the selected technologies covered in this study will not only improve farmers' yield and income, but may eventually contribute to lower production cost per unit and lower prices in the long run, which has implications to the whole value-chain of peanut and peanut-based products. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",55,,56-62,Pesticide adoption; Seed inoculant adoption; Seed treatment adoption; The peanut technology adoption; Decision making; Developing countries; Fertilizers; Irrigation; Pesticides; Adoption constraints; Chemical fertilizers; Local government units; Production technology; Regional differences; Seed treatment; Technology adoption; Technology promotions; Oilseeds; crop production; developing world; inoculation; legume; pesticide application; smallholder; Luzon; Philippines; Arachis hypogaea,

This paper investigates features of the technology assessment and adoption process in the U.S. public highway construction industry that both facilitate and hinder responsible innovation. Often technological innovations are incongruent with current specifications, i.e., regulatory construction standards, whereby specification reform serves as a precursor to implementation. We examine this aspect of technology assessment and adoption through a novel application of Kingdon's theory of policy agenda setting to a highly technical state bureaucratic institution using a case study on Intelligent Compaction. Specification reform relating to Intelligent Compaction is occurring in nearly a quarter of U.S. states. Analysis of interviews with industry professionals revealed that institutional incentives for supporting innovations were not the main drivers for adoption, and there exists a conservative culture that inhibits change. Individuals that go against this grain by championing change do so based on their personal character, ideological affiliations and a perceived sense of social obligation, which coincides with the principles set forth in the responsible research and innovation literature. These individuals, whom we identify as Kingdon's policy entrepreneurs, appear to present themselves in four roles in this industry: explorer, pioneer, gatekeeper, and leader. Our findings indicate that alignment of these roles creates an environment conducive to responsible technology assessment and adoption, and therefore greater societal benefit. Ultimately, we hope this study will benefit U.S. Highway Construction Industry regulatory environments by enhancing identification of specification processes, key roles, and personal/ ethical ideologies that may be conducive to fostering a culture of responsible innovation.

Issues related to climate change, energy security and sustainability in general are at the core of all energy policies and strategies. The development of new and more sustainable energy technologies are needed to address these challenges. As part of this, energy technology assessment tools can help decision-makers with the identification of sustainable energy solutions, in order to integrate them in long-term energy policies and strategies. The concept and practice of sustainable development has subsequently manifested in the technology assessment field. This implies the re-classification of technology assessment into ecological, economic and social (and other) goals. In the Southern African context, specifically, there is no formal and coherent approach to energy technology assessment from a sustainability perspective. Governments in the region are finding it challenging to establish national policies concerning energy technology assessment. Indeed, the review reveals the limited use of the term ‚Äútechnology assessment‚Äù in energy evaluation studies in Southern Africa. Energy sustainability assessments may be reported, but certainly not from the perspectives of the technology management community, and, although a number of studies have discussed the issues of sustainability in technology assessment, none account for technology sustainability assessment from a holistic perspective. The paper argues that it is in this area that further research is needed.",33,1,145-155,Technology assessment; Sustainability; Energy technologies; Southern Africa,

The results of the study confirm the widely held notion that the advent of mobile telephony in Nigeria has significantly improved telephone access among the strata of the population that could not afford the relatively expensive and inefficient fixed telephone lines. The relatively lower cost of acquiring GSM lines stands out more than any other factor as the driver of decision to adopt GSM lines by small-scale entrepreneurs. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that factors such as number of apprentices employed, sales turnover, and type of business are also important determinants of the adoption of GSM lines by small-scale entrepreneurs. The parameter estimates of these variables have positive sign and are statistically significant at 1% level. Results also suggest that the relatively new small-scale entrepreneurs are more proactive in the adoption of GSM lines than entrepreneurs that are older in business. In addition, the findings suggest that female small-scale entrepreneurs are generally younger in age though it is unclear whether they are more proactive than their male counterparts in the adoption of GSM lines. Entrepreneurs in service sectors are also more likely to adopt GSM lines than those in manufacturing. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis identified and described five US strengths (i.e. technology leaders, innovative tolerant culture, technology agnostic, market driven, speed) contributing industrial renewal through digitalisation, and five US weaknesses (i.e. technology driven, disorganised convergence, not part of the cultural identity, competitive not collaborative, short term perspective) inhibiting it. The strengths and weaknesses were further considered as they pertain to individuals, businesses and national policy. The study highlighted the systemic nature of the identified strengths and weaknesses, and suggested that in addition to policymakers, also research community and businesses should further strengthen what is already strong in the innovation system to indirectly mitigate the weaknesses. ¬© 2019, ¬© 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,,Digitalisation; industrial renewal; manufacturing; path dependence,

This study employs the structural equation model and chi-square test to explore public perception barriers to widespread adoption of BEVs in Tianjin. Based on a sample of 476 urban respondents collected by questionnaire, it finds that consumer interest in BEVs is relatively low and a large proportion of the respondents have a ""wait and see"" attitude. Consumers are unsure about BEVs performance, with safety, reliability, and range per charge being the top three concerns. Respondents who focus on vehicle performance express significantly lower BEV acceptance. High battery cost is the main technological barrier to widespread BEV adoption. In terms of public service support, poor public charging infrastructure ranks as the largest impeditive. In terms of respondent personal characteristics, older respondents have a more optimistic attitude to BEVs than younger generations, more respondents express interest to adopt BEVs as the second family car, experienced drivers are more concerned with the cost of battery and maintenance, and consumers who are more concerned about the environment are more likely to adopt BEVs.",56,,29-40,Battery electric vehicles; Barrier; Incentive policy; Public perception; China; ALTERNATIVE-FUEL VEHICLES; CONSUMER ATTITUDES; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; TECHNOLOGIES; PREFERENCES; BEHAVIOR; DEMAND; IMPACT; POLICY; INCENTIVES,

However, empirical evidence for this is largely lacking. This study intends to fill this gap by assessing the impact of business models, in particular battery and vehicle leasing, on Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption. By conducting a stated choice experiment, we examine to what extent car drivers switch their choices between conventional and electric vehicles after business models become available. The results based on the discrete choice model suggest that leasing does not increase EV adoption at the aggregate level. However, a latent transition analysis shows that different groups with internally homogeneous preferences react differently to leasing options at the disaggregate level. The results indicate that 13% of the car drivers changed their preferences, albeit in different ways. Transition probabilities are particularly related to attitudes towards leasing and knowledge of EV. The results show that leasing is useful in facilitating EV adoption for certain groups, which can be identified by their individual characteristics. In addition to these substantial insights, this paper makes a contribution to the literature by demonstrating the potential of latent transition analysis in uncovering heterogeneity in behavioral changes induced by policy or strategy interventions, especially when changes can occur in opposite directions.",116,,531-546,Business model; Lease; Electric vehicle; Latent transition analysis; ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES; DISCRETE-CHOICE ANALYSIS; CONSUMER; PREFERENCES; ATTITUDES; CARS,

Lack of charging infrastructure presents a major barrier to scaling up, but little public information exists on the infrastructure needed to support ridesourcing electrification. With data on ridesourcing trips for New York City and San Francisco, and using agent-based simulations of BEV fleets, we show that given a sparse network of three to four 50 kW chargers per square mile, BEVs can provide the same level of service as internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) at lower cost. This suggests that the cost of charging infrastructure is not a significant barrier to ridesourcing electrification. With coordinated use of charging infrastructure across vehicles, we also find that fleet performance becomes robust to variation in battery range and placement of chargers. Our analysis suggests that mandates on ridesourcing such as the California Clean Miles Standard could achieve electrification without significantly increasing the cost of ridesourcing services. ¬© 2019",105,,385-404,Agent-based simulation; Charging infrastructure; Electric vehicle; Ridesourcing; Battery electric vehicles; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Internal combustion engines; Secondary batteries; Systems analysis; Agent based simulation; Charging infrastructures; Fleet performance; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Level of Service; Public information; Sparse network; Charging (batteries); computer simulation; electrification; energy efficiency; public transport; transportation infrastructure; urban transport; California; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; San Francisco [California]; United States,

Generally seen as environmentally friendly with a small ecological footprint, the potential of urban ropeways has not yet been demonstrated in Germany. Applying the ‚Äòmulti-level perspective' established in transition research, we analyse challenges in the diffusion process. Results are based on 14 interviews with transport planning experts, ropeway manufacturers and actors from cities with urban ropeway projects. The following major obstacles are identified: (1) restricted route layout and interferences with urban landscapes inherently narrowing the niche for urban ropeways, (2) frequent lack of a clear concept of how the urban ropeway will connect with the existing public transport system, (3) established actor constellations and planning routines in the public transport regime blocking off the take-up of urban ropeways, and (4) increasing public opposition against infrastructure investment projects in general. At the same time, a number of drivers stimulate the diffusion process: (1) flagship projects and events can showcase urban ropeways, (2) the public transport regime generally experiences a pressure to become more innovative, leading to (3) regime actors themselves discovering urban ropeways as an interesting option, and (4) a stimulating effect is expected from the first urban ropeways to be actually implemented in Germany. Overall, the diffusion process is still at an early stage, but our results illustrate a wide-spread expectation that urban ropeways will become part of the German public transport repertoire in the future. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",61,,339-355,Diffusion of innovations; Multi-level-perspective; Public transport; Urban ropeways; Diffusion; Investments; Urban planning; Actor constellation; Ecological footprint; Infrastructure investment; Multilevels; Public transport systems; Urban transportation,

One way of reducing emissions in traffic is to establish the use of electric vehicles. However, given current market shares in Germany, the envisaged regime change from traditional combustion to electric engines seems rather unlikely, triggering the search for new options for dynamic market growth. Recent research has shown consumers' insufficient knowledge and high uncertainty towards electric vehicle (EV) technology. To overcome such acceptance barriers, this study hypothesises that experience in using car-sharing services-especially EV car sharing-can lead to higher acceptance of EV technology, entailing higher market diffusion. Using the Technology Acceptance Model, a quantitative survey with car-sharing users and non-users was conducted to assess the impact of car-sharing experience on acceptance of EVs. Furthermore, five possible predictors of EV acceptance were tested: mobility, car ownership, urbanity, ecological awareness and technophilia. Car-sharing users rated perceived EV usefulness higher than people without car-sharing experience. They also show a higher intention of buying EVs than non-users. Intention to use EVs in car-sharing schemes is positive amongst both groups. Identifying predictors of EV acceptance, results show that urbanity, ecological awareness, technophilia and car-sharing experience generally increase EV acceptance. Study results indicate that greater EV acceptance could be achieved by addressing highly mobile individuals living in urban areas, especially by having users of traditional car sharing switch to EV car sharing. Promoting EV car-sharing services and pushing a modal shift-in terms of reducing car ownership and raising individual mobility-in urban areas can serve as a policy instrument to push the mobility regime change towards EV technology.

This paper investigates what factors affect transit agencies' decisions to go beyond electric bus pilots to larger scale deployments, with the goal of identifying strategies to enable an accelerated transition to an electrified fleet. This mixed methods analysis utilized quantitative total cost of ownership analysis and qualitative interviews to study the barriers and drivers of electric bus investment for transit fleets in three case study states: California, Kentucky, and Massachusetts. A total cost of ownership analysis estimated electric buses are already more cost-effective than diesel buses in many agency contexts, but are sensitive to key parameters such as annual mileage, fossil fuel costs, and electricity tariffs and supporting policies that vary widely. Though multiple agencies in California reported planning to fully electrify their fleets, outside California where less supportive policies exist, fewer agencies reported planning to procure additional electric buses, primarily owing to high first cost and undesirable tradeoffs with maintaining transit service levels. Interview respondents also reported other substantial barriers such as oversubscribed grant programs, charging infrastructure costs, electricity costs, and additional operational complexity, suggesting a need for multiple complementary policies to overcome these barriers and ensure agencies can transition to a new technology without affecting transit service. ¬© National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.",,,,,SAGE Publications Ltd

Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) quantify the strength of user preferences and identify preference heterogeneity across users. We present the process of using a DCE to supplement conventional qualitative formative research in the design of a demand creation intervention for voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) to prevent HIV in Tanzania. Methods: The VMMC intervention was designed within a 3-month formative phase. In-depth interviews (n = 30) and participatory group discussions (n = 20) sought to identify broad setting-specific barriers to and facilitators of VMMC among adult men. Qualitative results informed the DCE development, identifying the role of female partners, service providers' attitudes and social stigma. A DCE among 325 men in Njombe and Tabora, Tanzania, subsequently measured preferences for modifiable VMMC service characteristics. The final VMMC demand creation intervention design drew jointly on the qualitative and DCE findings. Results: While the qualitative research informed the community mobilization intervention, the DCE guided the specific VMMC service configuration. The significant positive utilities (u) for availability of partner counselling (u = 0.43, p < 0.01) and age-separated waiting areas (u = 0.21, p < 0.05) led to the provision of community information booths for partners and provision of age-separated waiting areas. The strong disutility of female healthcare providers (u = - 0.24, p < 0.01) led to re-training all providers on client-friendliness. Conclusion: This is, to our knowledge, the first study documenting how user preferences from DCEs can directly inform the design of a complex intervention. The use of DCEs as formative research may help increase user uptake and adherence to complex interventions. ¬© 2019 The Author(s).",20,1,,"Choice experiment; Formative research; HIV; Preferences; Tanzania; Voluntary medical male circumcision; adult; article; circumcision; controlled study; counseling; female; health care personnel; health science; human; human experiment; Human immunodeficiency virus; interview; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; qualitative research; social stigma; attitude to health; clinical trial (topic); cognition; decision making; health personnel attitude; methodology; patient attitude; procedures; psychology; research subject; spouse; young adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Choice Behavior; Circumcision, Male; Clinical Trials as Topic; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Research Design; Research Subjects; Spouses; Volition",

India is perceived to be a key driver of global oil demand in coming decades due to the potential increase in car use driven by a fast growing national average income. However, it is possible that India could surprise the world by aggressively pursuing an electrified transit agenda within and between cities and associated supporting local transport with electric vehicles, together with renewable power to fuel this transport. The changes will require two innovations that this article focuses on. First, innovative financing of urban and intercity rail through land-based finances as funding and financing of such projects has been a global challenge. Second, enabling Indian cities to rapidly adopt solar energy for all its electrified transport systems over oil plus car dependence.

To accommodate this demographic shift, governmental policies point to ‚Äòageing in place' as key. This article outlines research findings of an initial investigation into the uptake of technology to support ‚Äòageing in place'. The study sets out to identify both incentives and barriers to the uptake under four key activity criteria‚Äî medical, monitoring, mobility and social‚Äîat three built environment scales‚Äîhome, street and neighbourhood, for urban, semi-urban and rural locations‚Äîto support older adults to live independently in their community. Results show that whilst there are significant and justified concerns over the limitations of physical conditions to support ‚Äòageing in place', most physical conditions along with age are not barriers to the uptake of technology, as uptake is high regardless of circumstances. However, the study revealed that uptake is dependent on level of training, if shown to lead to increasing independence, includes a level of ‚Äòenjoyment of use', and does not replace existing physical relationships. The study also identified that there is limited research around the use of technology for either mobility or social activities outside the home; rather, research focus is concerned with medical monitoring in the home. Finally, research overlooks the role of geographic demographics to support ‚Äòageing in place'.

A dynamic structure of the agricultural and forestry biomass process activities (i.e. production, transport, conversion and consumption) based on regional time-series data was built, implemented into and calibrated within a dynamic simulation tool (Vensim software) within a Hungarian county. Besides the agriculture and forestry sectors, the model includes data about demography, economy, environment and land use, among others. For carrying out the assessment, realistic scenarios of future biomass processes and of biomass use were formulated, characterised by quantitative sustainable development indicators and simulated within the dynamic model. The results prove that the introduced model supports decision making of biomass utilisation in a regional scale, through comparing and analysing quantitative changes of economic, social and environment indicators, which characterise a sustainable regional development. The model therefore allows analyses and evaluation of not only partial prosperous or adverse characteristics of biomass processes and use, but also to relate regional components and their development over time. The developed dynamic tool is therefore a powerful method to model complex systems, such as a regional energy system, considering the framework of the regional preferences stated by the regional stakeholders.

Two analytical perspectives were used to identify critical organisational functions, drivers for change and the anchoring of these decisions within policy: (i) a sustainability transitions framework, and (ii) a policy trickle-down study assessing policy-concept uptake by stakeholders. Critical functions supporting implementation of source-separating systems in H+ were: common vision, leadership, cross-sectoral cooperation, and an innovative approach both within the utility and in the city administration in Helsingborg. In Stockholm, with regard to source-separating wastewater systems, there was a lack of common vision and of cross-sectoral cooperation and leadership. This was also evident in the lack of uptake by stakeholders of the policies for source separation. In Helsingborg, the main drivers for source-separating wastewater systems are increased biogas generation and improved potential for nutrient recycling. In Stockholm, these drivers have not been enough to create change, but the potential for increased heat recovery from greywater at source may be the additional driver necessary for future implementation of source-separating wastewater systems. Comparison of the stalled source-separation policy in Stockholm with a successfully implemented policy in a related field found a key criteria to be the presence of inspired individuals in positions where they had the mandate as well as the ability to create a common vision for change. ¬© 2019 Water Alternatives.",12,2,588-608,Resource recovery; Source separation; Sustainable urban development; Sweden; Wastewater; decision making; policy implementation; sanitation; sustainability; urban development; wastewater treatment; water resource; Helsingborg; Skane; Stockholm [Sweden],

It particularly stresses the role of the great global transmissions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in presenting intractable barriers to returning to less complicated eras of resource conflicts. These transitions are manifest in total and urban populations‚Äô growth and shift to urbanization; radical shifts in the nutrition demanded by the new economic and social developments; the radical changes in land use and chemicals in agriculture; a rapid shift in emphasis on renewable energy resources and reduced reliance on fossil fuels; and finally the great challenge of climate change. All of these transitions have major implications for water security both globally, and regionally. Globally this is well articulated by DuBois (The case for ‚Äúenergy-smart food for people and climate‚Äù. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Food Day-Oct 16, 2015): Our agrifood systems currently consume 30 percent of the world‚Äôs available energy-with more than 70 percent occurring beyond the farm gate, and produce about 20 percent of the world‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions. More than one third of the food we produce is lost or wasted, and with it about 38 percent of the energy consumed in the agrifood chain. To this we can add that the greatest loss of water in the overall national water balances is that of the water used to grow the food that is wasted. While the water security situation for the Arab Middle East Region is generally considered bleak, the paper is fairly optimistic that, at least water resource use, until 2050 will be still manageable if the eleven ‚Äútechnical fixes,"" outlined in the paper are pursued. These technical fixes are not to be construed as purely engineering the water supply, but fixes to many of the economic and social barriers to a more secure water future. They cover major national policy choices such as international trade in virtual water, traditional water engineering of traditional and non-traditional sources, improving efficiency in use via agronomic research, improvement of post harvest food and value chains, and softer optionssuch as trading among users, pricing, rationalizing property rights and legal protection for third parties. ¬© Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,21-43,Springer International Publishing,Agrifood; Food security; Water security; Agronomy; Chains; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Land use; Population statistics; Renewable energy resources; Urban growth; Water resources; Water supply; Food and agriculture organizations; Improving efficiency; National policies; Social development; Twentieth century; Climate change,

A large majority of households in the region rely on traditional biomass fuels for cooking, which represent a significant proportion of energy used in the domestic setting. The disadvantages of these fuels are many: they are inefficient energy carriers and their heat is difficult to control; they produce dangerous emissions; and their current rate of extraction is not sustainable for forests. Transition to clean cooking fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or ethanol would resolve many of these issues as they do not produce dangerous particulate emissions, and are commercially viable, offering a number of socio-economic advantages over traditional options. Despite the benefits of fuel switching, clean cooking fuels are rarely used in households in sub-Saharan Africa. Their failure to attain widespread use can be attributed to a number of market barriers. One of the major issues is cost: clean cooking fuels are prohibitively expensive for many households, and the high price of compatible stoves further discourages their use. Besides the expense, many consumers are hesitant to adopt the new technology, reflecting the lack of public awareness of the relevant issues. At the same time, Africa's underdeveloped infrastructure prevents these fuels from being made available in many local marketplaces. To date, this combination of factors has largely stifled the transition to clean cooking fuels. National governments can adopt a number of strategies to address these issues. The creation of clean cooking-fuel initiatives at the national level would be an important first step, after which governments can begin to address the issues more effectively. The introduction of relevant financial instruments would help to tackle the economic barriers to clean cooking fuels, and public outreach and education could overcome socio-cultural obstacles. Through such a policy framework, national governments can play a significant role in encouraging the transition to clean cooking fuels.",,,iv-pp,biogas; climate change; energy consumption; ethanol; fuels; fuelwood; liquid petroleum gas,

These include limited ecological benefits, heightened food insecurity across many developing countries as well as exploitation of local residents by bioenergy producers. There remains a dearth of empirical evidence devoted to investigating bioenergy's potential as a sustainable energy alternative in developing countries. It is against this background that our paper is aimed at making two contributions: one, to provide a ground level empirical data on bioenergy initiatives in the Indian Punjab region and, two, to examine the theoretical contribution of eco-socialist perspective to assess the sustainability potentials of bioenergy in developing economies. The eco-socialist perspective treats environmental degradation as a ‚Äòsystemic issue' and considers the power and class structures in capitalism as the central explanatory parameters in explaining the process of environmental degradation. As a part of the transition from capitalism to eco-socialism, the eco-socialists advocate for a participatory approach to environmental decision making to ensure that ecological justice emerges as the central parameter of sustainable development. The theoretical framing of the case study research on bioenergy projects in the region of Punjab, India was informed by the eco-socialist vision. The case study employed a ‚Äòmultiple stakeholder' approach to explore the opportunities and contestations surrounding bioenergy projects in Punjab. Identifying key flaws as well as the promises of bioenergy in Punjab that were investigated, our research revealed that in order to be a sustainable energy alternative that meets the objective of ecological and social justice, bioenergy policies need to address the needs of local communities and be cognizant of the inherent socio-economic embeddedness of these initiatives.",124,,104630,Bioenergy; Sustainability; Stakeholder approach; Eco-socialism; Environmental justice; Case study,

First, we find socioeconomic and demographic factors such as income, education, access to urban infrastructure, and location of household, as key drivers of households' choice of LPG as main cooking energy source. Again the influences of these factors are stable across time, and with a strong price effect. The evidence shows that urban households with better socioeconomic and demographic factors are likely to adopt LPG as the main cooking fuel relative to households in rural areas and also urban households with poor socioeconomic and demographic factors. Finally, we observe that the imposition of fully parametric structure (functional form) prior to estimation on factors such as age of household head, income, and household size as done in the literature is inappropriate, at least in the case of Ghana and tend to bias the marginal effects. There is strong evidence of variations in the response rate of LPG adoption over the domains of income, household size, and the age of the household head.

Scarcity of wood and negative impacts on health and environment have motivated efforts to design and distribute “improved” cook-stoves in developing countries. In India, adoption is limited despite massive promotion over many decades. Existing research suggests that many rural women in India do not want improved stoves, and those who do face obstacles to adoption. We step back from the many good case studies to examine the broader story of improved cook-stoves (ICs) in India. We do so by bringing together technical research of applied science and narrative critique of social science. Rather than assuming a priori that traditional stoves require replacement, we ask why Indian cook-stoves been a magnet for so much attention, why adoptions rates have remained low, and what lessons might be learned from a broad, multi-disciplinary perspective. Our approach is critical and reflexive, given our own involvement in IC efforts, and puts gender at the center. Our “big picture” review shows that the Indian chulha, for all its problems, is a remarkably successful technology which also satisfies several important household needs. Hence, targeting this device for obsolescence has profound implications that cannot be reduced to energy consumption or environmental hazards. Rural women do not prioritize ICs, but addressing their priorities requires either capital-intensive investment or challenging powerful institutions. In contrast, IC interventions are relatively cheap, decentralized, mechanical and seemingly apolitical, hence their popularity in development programs. Our review of chulha research leads us to reject both the optimism of development planners who frame such problems as technical and the antagonistic pessimism of their critics.

The development of a sustainable sector, that does not further marginalise rural populations, is restricted by limited understanding of these stakeholders. We assess the heterogeneity of rural producers supplying two differentially sized urban charcoal markets in Mozambique. Drawing on data from 767 household surveys, our findings suggest that the size of the urban market affects the type of rural producer and their scales of production. Overall household income of producers supplying the larger urban market were proportionally more dependent on charcoal for income generation; small-scale producers in particular relied most on charcoal income, contributing >95% of household incomes. In contrast, producers supplying the smaller market had more diversified incomes, and were thus less dependent on charcoal income. Larger-scale producers were generally wealthier; their absolute incomes were higher and they were proportionally the least dependent on charcoal income. Further findings suggest that rural charcoal production was not necessarily the domain of the poorest of the poor and the existence of producers trapped in small-scale production may be a consequence of larger urban markets, rather than an intrinsic characteristic of the sector. Predicted growth of smaller urban areas and associated higher demand for charcoal will provide substantial opportunities for rural income generation, most likely leading to shifts in producers and production scales. Rather than transferring existing formal approaches, which marginalise rural stakeholders, small urban areas provide opportunities to develop equitable production systems, with potential to deliver sustainable energy and rural development. The heterogeneity of rural producers calls for better-targeted interventions that incorporate the importance of charcoal production for rural livelihoods.",113,,237-245,Livelihoods; Poverty; Africa; Smallholder; Woodfuel; Charcoal,

In Tanzania, government policy has been aimed mostly at connecting households to the electricity grid. However, the public health, environmental and social benefits of access to modern energy sources are likely to be diminished in a context of significant fuel stacking.

Second, households that already use and, therefore spend money to acquire LPG or charcoal are indifferent to prices of other fuels. At the same time, households using and spending positive amounts on multiple cooking fuels (charcoal and LPG) are insensitive to the prices of other fuels. Third, although income plays a role in rural and urban residents’ expenditures on LPG, it is insignificant in terms of urban residents’ spending on charcoal.

The resulting distortions in prices work at odds with policies to improve energy efficiency and reduce the cost of energy services and associated externalities such as health and environmental damages. The analysis developed in this article finds that kerosene is used in 173 countries, at a cost to consumers of $43.4B/y, $60.3B/y including direct economic subsidies, and $77.2B/y including certain externalities. Despite low world oil prices, direct economic subsidies for kerosene were $18.4B in 2013, and $34.7B including environmental externalities. These values correspond to 72% and 56% of total kerosene costs being passed through to consumers, respectively. When excluding advanced economies, the pass-through values fall to 40% and 35%. Approximately 52% of the global kerosene supply receives direct subsidy, or 63% when externality costs are considered. The cooking end use receives $2.0B/y in direct kerosene subsidies, lighting $7.1B/y, and heating and other residual uses $9.3B/y, or $76 per over all households each year. Defining subsidies at this level of granularity is useful for pinpointing policy issues and opportunities. Promoting a transition to energy efficient off-grid energy services is one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing dependency on subsidies. However, the very presence of subsidies undercuts this process by diluting market price signals and rendering energy efficiency investments less cost-effective, while competing with other social and development-focused budgetary needs.

We analyze data from Demographic and Health Surveys in 69 countries to identify determinants of transition from solid to cleaner fuel. Estimates from a population-averaged linear model show that population density and size, rural population share, income inequality, and charcoal production are positively associated with countries’ solid fuel use, while GDP per capita, electricity and natural gas production have the opposite effect. Economic development, measured as GDP per capita, has the strongest link to solid fuel use: a standard deviation increase in per capita GDP above its mean reduces solid fuel use from 70% to 57% of households. Electricity production is another strong predictor: solid fuel use drops by 11% when electricity production increases by one standard deviation above the mean. In addition, in a fixed-effects linear model, population size has a positive association with solid fuel use, while increases in GDP per capita and the number of governments’ renewable energy incentives are associated with lower dependence on solid fuels.",114,,267-280,Fuel transition; Solid fuel; Energy policies; Global focus,

There are sustained efforts being made by government to overhaul their subsidy systems, introduce pro-poor financial schemes, and bolster infrastructure so as to increase adoption and use of LPG in the rural landscape. Despite such initiatives, demand side issues of adoption, sustained and exclusive use of LPG by these communities remain. We argue in the paper that uptake and sustained use of LPG is a function of economic and social determinants, which have not been systematically studied so far. Energy-society relationship is intricate. Vulnerability of energy poor population exacerbates the intricacies of this relationship. Evidence base on strategies fostering uptake and sustained use of LPG among energy poor communities is weak and anecdotal. Unless we explore the economic and social determinants of adoption and sustained use of LPG, larger policy level initiatives on pro-poor LPG dissemination will not render adequate success to address energy poverty.

In rural areas, decentralized energy solutions may play a significant role in reducing poverty, supporting community institutions and facilitating the generation of basic services such as communication, water access, education and health services. However, the majority of dwellers in off-grid communities in developing countries have little or no access to modern energy technologies, although they are endowed with a vast potential of renewable energy resources. Decentralized energy solutions could serve as an option to solve this energy access problem. However, the previous literature indicates that there are financial, technical, infrastructural, and institutional constraints to scale up decentralized energy options. This paper seeks to study the underlying factors behind the successes and failures of household- and community-based decentralized energy technologies through local case studies from different parts of the world, analyzed through the lenses of the Water-Energy-Food Security (WEF) nexus. First, the paper reviews the literature on the main benchmarks used to evaluate the success and failure of community-based energy. Second, the conceptual framework relating decentralized energy to the WEF nexus elements is briefly described. Thirdly, the methods and data used in the paper are described, followed by the presentation of the case studies. Lastly, the paper is concluded by drawing policy lessons and recommendations.

VTL can revolutionize traffic management in urban areas as it can substantially reduce commute time of urban workers, increase productivity, and lead to a greener environment. In a VTL environment, vehicles self-organize to elect a leader which serves as a virtual traffic light to decide the right of way at that intersection, thus replacing the current physical traffic lights. Implementing VTL technology with partial penetration, however, is an outstanding issue that needs to be addressed.

The Montreal Protocol aims to phase out 96 ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), used in thousands of products in 240 sectors, through transition to ozone-safe technologies throughout the world in a specified time frame. Governments' recognition that countries had ""common but differential responsibility"" for the problem of ozone depletion as well as for its solution resulted in three important features of the Protocol: a grace period for developing countries (Article 5); transfer of technology to other countries to help phase out ODSs (Article 10A); and a financial mechanism-the Multilateral Fund-to help developing countries' transition from ozone-depleting to ozone-friendly technology (Article 10). The Global Environment Facility (GEF) helped Countries with Economies in Transition (CEIT), which did not qualify for aid from the Multilateral Fund. The financial mechanism has done more than simply provide funds: It has removed barriers to technology change, enabled action on phase out much earlier than required under the Protocol, spurred industry to develop alternatives and make the switch, raised awareness about ozone depletion, pushed countries to develop national goals and phaseout plans, and helped countries establish regulations and policies to promote technology change. As a result, technology change occurred faster and cheaper than predicted, with even the poorest countries confidently and cost-effectively phasing out ODSs.

In recent years, the investment in RES units in EU, especially PV plants, have been encountering new financing barriers, in particular due to dwindling national budgets available for supporting the RES expansion, leading to reduction of the Feed-in tariffs (FIT) and increasing the regulatory risk perception. A similar situation can be observed in the countries of South Eastern Europe (SEE), where PV expansion in some countries that already experienced a ""PV boom"" slowed down to a trickle, while in others the PV growth hadn't even begun due to tougher investment conditions. Among the ways to overcome the risk-related hesitance of the traditional financing institutions and spur the RES growth are also various alternative financing schemes, e.g. online crowdfunding platforms or energy cooperatives.

Understanding the factors that influence energy transitions at a household level, is essential for successful strategies to promote the uptake of cleaner fuels and deliver associated socio-economic benefits. Such fast-growing cities often display intra-urban inequalities of considerable magnitude which can condition individual access to resources and impact the effectiveness of energy provision strategies for individual city districts. In this paper we will use the results of a survey of 500 households in Bangalore, India and explore how this data compares with the 'wave concept' model of energy transition. This 'wave concept' view of energy transitions focuses on appliance ownership as a proxy for energy services and conceptualises the uptake of appliances as a wave with early and late adopters rather than an income-based step change, and as a result better accounts for the role of non-income factors. The wards targeted by the survey cover a range of low-income ward typologies characterised by factors including income, livelihoods, building construction, socio-cultural factors, access to fuels, and reliability of supply. Validating an appropriate model for the uptake of new energy technologies and fuels in households, can better inform policy makers, entrepreneurs, and engineers on the influence of non-income barriers to energy transition across different districts of a city. By understanding how households use energy, and what limits the adoption of more efficient technologies at a local level, city planners and engineers can develop targeted sustainable strategies for adoption of cleaner more efficient fuels and appliances in households. ¬© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",294,,Institute of Physics Publishing,Economic and social effects; Economics; Fuels; Surveys; Sustainable development; Building construction; Efficient technology; New energy technologies; Reliability of supply; Socio-economic benefits; Sociocultural factors; Sustainable economics; Sustainable strategies; Climate change,

Emphasis is now placed on achieving economic social and environmental outcomes, the triple bottom line. Government, regional and industry organisations are using various instruments of influence to exert pressure on grain growers to implement better on-farm natural resource management (NRM) practices. Past strategies aimed at influencing the grower by appealing to their land stewardship and altruisms have proved worthwhile, as evidenced by increasing grower understanding of NRM problems. However, there has been a failure to deliver significant on-ground changes. Research into the adoption of NRM has suggested that the major factors that influence uptake are farm income, education and future farm planning. Other factors, such as individual farmer and social characteristics, have been identified as less important. A study by Gallopín (2002, pp. 361-392 in: Gunderson, L.H. and Holling, C.S. (eds), Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems, Island Press, Washington) suggests that decision making processes for sustainable development are hampered by a (1) lack of political willingness, (2) a deficiency in understanding of environmental problems and their consequences and (3) the insufficient adaptive capacity (both financial and social) to act on the changes needed in the realm of physical possibility. This characterisation of the decision domain provides a useful model of the NRM adoption situation in Australia. The authors suggest that the pressure groups identified above will drive the willingness and understanding of future growers perceptions; whereas capacity is solely left to the individual grower. Here any decision to undertake NRM is based on uncertainty of the consequences of this adoption. There is much scope for research into the physical capacity of the farm to undertake NRM i.e. what are the benefits and costs of adopting NRM strategies. The application of precision agriculture technology into this area can reduce the uncertainty in the decision making process by being able to quantify both the short-term effect on grower's income and long-term effect on environmental degradation. The aim of this paper is to highlight the drivers and determinants of NRM adoption at the farm scale. This paper also identifies additional information that will be needed if any real on-ground changes are to occur on ground. The ""farms capacity to change"" should be examined ahead of the grower's capacity to adopt if the grower's uncertainties about NRM practices are to be diminished. This paper identifies precision agriculture as a technology for reducing the uncertainty in the decision making process because data is collected at a scale in which these NRM decisions are made. Precision agriculture can estimate the opportunity costs associated with NRM adoption and further help in the understanding of the degree to which a farm can adopt NRM practices.

Having a crucial role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, they can also contribute to ensure universal access to modern energy services. French Guiana as a French overseas territory is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels. It is a two-tier society where there is a large gap between the coastal and the inland areas concerning energy access. Compared to the coastline, the household electrification rate in the rural areas remains lower. In addition, the expected demographic growth and the aging of production means raise profound questions about how sustainably meet projected energy demand. According to the French Energy Transition for Green Growth Act, the main objective is to develop renewable and clean energy in order to achieve energy self-sufficiency for the entire territory. Due to its favorable location offering a wide range of potential renewable sources, French Guiana is a good candidate for developing efficient and environmentally-friendly renewable generation projects. However, there are still many barriers to overcome in order to facilitate investments in this risky field. This paper aims to make an inventory of the energy situation in French Guiana, identify the challenges restricting the widespread use of renewable energy and propose some recommendations towards a sustainable development. ¬© 2018 IEEE.",,133-136,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Energy mix; French Guiana; Renewable energy; Sustainable development; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum prospecting; Planning; Smart city; Smart power grids; Demographic growth; Energy self-sufficiency; Energy transitions; Renewable energies; Renewable generation; Use of renewable energies; Investments,

At the same time, during 2007 and 2008, there has been a significant discussion and development of solar market transition strategies. The new market support mechanisms rely on the use of Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) to support the majority of new project development. This paper will review the history, current status, promise and issues the solar market transition is creating. Three perspectives will be addressed: 1) industry - including examples of customer financial returns under the old and new models, 2) regulatory and rate-payer, including a discussion of strategies for reducing the projected total costs for meeting the solar set aside in New Jersey's Renewable Portfolio Standard, and 3) administrative and program design - including the methods and strategies being deployed to facilitate the market transition.

With IEEE 802.11n products, data rates beyond 500Mb/(s) are soon feasible for Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Due to a standstill in standardization the project IEEE 802.15.3a it was disbanded in 2006. Companies are pushing therefore their own solutions to the Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) market. Shortly, 480Mb/(s) will be available for WPAN applications. For large scale networks, IEEE 802.16 (aka Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)) offers a solution for the Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) market. Besides point-to-point connections, IEEE 802.16e supports mobile connections too. With recent development, wireless technology for ubiquitous connections is available in the market. Sensitive Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCSs), Multiple Input/Multiple Output (MIMO) and other new Physical Layer (PHY) technologies provide high data rates. However, upcoming wireless technology does not increase coverage. Like preceding standards, highest data rate is only available for short range communication. Therefore, supply of large areas with high speed connections demands dense installation of backbone connected devices. While Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) for hardware is low, deployment is expensive. The Operational Expenditure (OPEX) of wired and fiber optic networks is high. Furthermore they are not as widely deployed as needed for dense installation of connection points to the core network. Hence, rollout of high speed wireless networks is delayed until a solution is provided. Relay based deployment and Mesh topology for wireless networks helps to overcome the cost barrier. With this meshing functionality, wireless networks of the IEEE 802 standard family are a promising low-cost alternative to cellular Third-Generation (3G) networks In this paper we provide insight to current activities of Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineering (IEEE) Working Groups (WGs) regarding Mesh technology.

However, framing the role of the sustainable energy development in a mono-functional way does not allow for to use efficiently its multifunctional potential linked to sustainable development. As a result, the disconnection between energy and broader spatial and urban development agenda underplays the importance of potential synergy-effects between renewable energy production and-use and its localized context. The guiding narrative of this paper is that single although innovative solutions are insufficient and poor integration of sustainable energy-related initiatives creates barriers to achieve sustainability and limits potential synergies with their spatial context. Therefore, new demands on integrative and spatially sensitive approaches to the renewable energy development appear often catalysed by the implementation of the smart city concept and subsequent evolution of energy systems towards smart grids. This paper attempts to examine possible approaches to better understand how renewable energy systems and initiatives emerge, how to maintain and enhance them, and under which conditions they co-evolve with their unique context in a more structured and productive way towards the vision of smart city.",,,The Design Society,Energy Transition; Niche Management; Renewable Energy; Smart City; Spatial Planning; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Mergers and acquisitions; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Energy transitions; Innovative solutions; Niche managements; Renewable energies; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy systems; Sustainable energy development; Smart power grids,
I,Not a Program,Conference Proceedings,2009,"Goodbody, S. A.",Successfully eliminating the barriers to solar photovoltaic implementation,,9780791843192 (ISBN),,,"For the majority of commercial and industrial facilities in the United States, electrical power represents a significant portion of their total operating costs and a cost over which they have little or no control. The cost of electrical power has risen dramatically during the past three years, and is projected to continue to increase due to uncertainties in global fuel supply, production investments necessary to meet increasing demand, increased maintenance and repair costs of aging production and transmission infrastructure, the decommissioning and remediation of life-expired generating facilities, and the implementation of increasingly stringent pollution control measures. These trends and influences are seen, to a greater or lesser extent, across the entire nation, but their impact upon the northeast and mid-Atlantic states of Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey and Delaware has been particularly significant. While solar photovoltaic systems can provide an excellent on-site power source for many commercial and industrial facilities, and would reduce the burden on the existing, over-stretched and aging national power transmission infrastructure, the high capital cost of solar photovoltaic systems represents a significant barrier to the wide-scale commercial adoption of this technology. In an attempt to overcome this barrier, individual states are implementing a variety of rebate and incentive programs designed to promote the installation and use of solar power systems. However a unifying Federal Renewable Portfolio Standard does not presently exist and the complex administration demand of state programs represents a further barrier to adoption for many companies. Further, while a Federal Investment Tax Credit is available, certain organizations for whom solar photovoltaic power would otherwise be an attractive cost-saving opportunity, notably municipalities and non-profits, are generally unable to take advantage of this benefit. In response to this unsatisfactory situation, Soltage, Inc. designs, installs, operates, maintains, and retains ownership of commercial-scale solar photovoltaic power stations at client sites, providing solar-generated power directly to the client. Our customers incur no capital, maintenance or operating costs, and have no administrative burden beyond purchasing solar-generated power at rates that are below their existing utility rate and which are stabilized and guaranteed into the future. For our clients, this is their most effective means of controlling and stabilizing energy expenses in the immediate and long terms. For our nation, this is the key to rapidly implementing the adoption and scale-up of solar photovoltaic power, with all of its inherent benefits.

Progress is often slow and best practice is yet to be established. 'Intermediaries' are actors who facilitate knowledge sharing and build actor networks to enable the introduction of new technologies. This paper uses a case study of the UK to explore where and how the activities of these intermediary actors are currently supporting district heating development. An innovative method called a 'decision theatre' was used to collect empirical evidence from a range of local stakeholders involved in district heating projects. This method, which took place in the format of a group workshop, enables understanding of the interactions between stakeholders through each stage of the district heating development process. Lessons are drawn from this case study with regard to how intermediary activities can support the development of district heating in areas with little previous history of such systems. Three geographical scales of intermediary activity are identified (local, regional and national) as having different roles in enabling delivery of new district heating projects. Interactions between the three scales and how their roles might change as the sector develops are explored. The paper will highlight implications of the study for policymakers. In particular, a role is identified for intermediaries in creating a supportive institutional and policy environment that can enable development of large-scale, strategic networks. ¬© 2017 The Authors.

This paper reviews empirical studies that analyze choices of fuel and adoption of improved stoves for cooking in countries where biomass is still the predominant cooking fuel. The review highlights the wide range of factors that influence householdsâ€™ cooking fuel choices and adoption of improved stoves, including socioeconomic (access and availability, collection costs and fuel prices, household income, education and awareness), behavioral (food tastes, lifestyle), and cultural and external factors (indoor air pollution, government policies). The paper also summarizes the evidence on the significant adverse health impacts from exposure to indoor smoke, especially among women and young children. In low-income households, perceived health benefits of adopting improved stoves and financial benefits from fuel savings tend to be outweighed by the costs of improved stoves, even after accounting for the opportunity cost of time spent collecting biomass fuel.

Against this background, this book develops a sociotechnical approach to the challenge of reducing energy demand and illustrates this with a number of empirical case studies from the United Kingdom. In doing so, it explores the emergence, diffusion and impact of low-energy innovations, including electric vehicles and smart meters.

While marked by some successful programmes at both large and small scales, this is generally acknowledged to be a challenging area for policy and implementation. This mixed-method systematic review aims to contribute to this endeavour by identifying those factors which can help ensure more successful delivery of policies and programmes that promote improved solid fuel stoves (ICS) and/or clean fuels. The main objective of this systematic review was to describe and assess the importance of different enabling and/or limiting factors that have been found to influence the large-scale uptake by households of cleaner and more efficient household energy technologies.

However, the alternative fuel stacking model suggests that, as households become more urbanized, they diversify their energy sources while continue using firewood and charcoal. This study aimed to assess the extent to which biomass energy still plays an important role as a source of energy for household consumption across the urbanization spectrum of communities. Three villages in Khon Kaen province in Northeast Thailand representing the rural, suburban and urban communities were selected for study. Data were collected on energy uses at household level using a formal questionnaire survey along with field observation and field measurement. The results showed that total household energy consumption increased with urbanization. The absolute quantity of biomass energy used slightly increased when going from rural (5.52 GJ caput?1 y?1) to suburban (6.06 GJ caput?1 y?1) but greatly decreased for urban community (1.98 GJ caput?1 y?1), while the relative share declined with greater urbanization, being 46.2, 37.4 and 10.2% for the rural, suburban and urban communities, respectively. Both firewood and charcoal were used primarily for cooking, with a small amount used for home industry. It was concluded that, although the share of biomass energy in household energy portfolios does decline relative to modern energy sources in the course of urbanization, as predicted by the energy ladder model, there is no sharp discontinuity in utilization of energy sources between communities at different stages of urbanization and biomass continue to be an important component of household energy portfolios in all communities, supporting the fuel stacking model. It appears likely that biomass will remain an important source of household energy in Thailand for an extended period.",10,,"4180-4188

Although traditional biofuels already enjoy widespread popularity, their use has often been actively discouraged due to the lingering influence of “fuelwood crisis” era narratives. In particular, urban fuelwood consumption is frequently portrayed as a cause of environmental degradation leading to energy insecurity among low-income households, especially where the resource is commercialized. Such views have had significant influence among policy makers, often resulting in repressive forestry legislation. In contrast, however, a number of researchers have demonstrated that wood energy dependence is often not a significant cause of deforestation and can provide important livelihood opportunities. This article reassesses urban fuelwood sourcing and its impacts using a recent case study conducted by the authors in Maun, Botswana and results previously reported in the literature. Findings indicate that although harvesting is unregulated, its impacts are significantly mitigated by collectors' strong preferences for source sites with abundant dead wood, low competition and recognized access rights. As well, fuelwood vending is found to provide critical support to rural incomes and a key source of low-cost urban energy. As such, the benefits of fuelwood use and avoidance of negative effects will most effectively be achieved by decentralised management approaches that build on local institutions and understandings of the resource.",11,,"1605-1616

This study reports on the patterns of household energy use in five rural settlements in 1991 and again in 2002. Results indicate a changing pattern of energy use for lighting and powering entertainment appliances, more specifically from dry-cell batteries and paraffin to electricity. Yet for thermal needs, most notably cooking, fuelwood has remained the most widespread fuel, and the amount used per month has not changed, despite increasing scarcity of wood in the local environment. There has been an increase in the proportion of households purchasing fuelwood as opposed to collecting their own. Overall, the mean total number of fuel types used per household has increased, indicating that electricity is simply viewed as an additional energy, rather than an alternative. Yet, electricity accounted for approximately 60% of expenditure on energy sources in 2002, despite the government's policy of a free basic allowance of 5–6 kWh per month.

Household income is an important, but not the only, factor. Opportunity costs of firewood also play an essential role. Empirical results are based on the 2000 Guatemalan LSMS survey, which includes a detailed section on energy use. Patterns of fuel use, energy spending, Engel curves, multiple fuels, the extent of fuel switching, and the determinants of fuel choice are analyzed. It is common in Guatemala to use multiple fuels for cooking – 48 and 27 per cent of urban and rural households do so. Modern fuels are often used alongside traditional solid fuels; modern fuels thus fail to displace solid fuels in many cases, particular in rural areas and the urban bottom half. This is paradoxical since a significant share of firewood users buy wood from the market, incurring costs that are substantial, also in comparison with the costs of modern fuels.",10,3,337–361,,

Fuel wood represents 50% of total residential energy use in the country. This paper presents the results of a detailed study of the patterns of household fuel wood use and inter-fuel substitution in three villages of rural Mexico. All residents in the three villages cook with fuel wood, and between 20 and 43% of them also use LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) for this task, depending on the village. Average household fuel wood demand ranges between 53 and 60 GJ/yr for fuel wood only users and from 40 to 57 GJ/yr for mixed fuel wood-LPG users, depending on the village. Cooking practices are described together with their energy use. Kitchen performance tests and controlled cooking tests (CCT) were applied in two villages to measure savings in household fuel wood use from partially switching to LPG. The analysis shows that energy and fuel wood savings are much lower than those that may be expected on a purely technical basis. In fact, fuel wood is very seldom replaced entirely, even in households that have been using LPG for many years. Rather than switching, households follow a multiple fuel strategy which gives them the advantages of both fuels. There is a strong pattern of fuel preferences by type of dish and cooking task. Fuel wood is seen as a fuel with advantages that go beyond price and include cultural considerations. Lorena-type improved woodburning cookstoves might prove particularly useful for multiple fuel users as they show savings of up to 50% for tortilla-making compared with the traditional stoves in CCT.",12,5,437-361,Rural energy; fuel wood; inter-fuel substitution; fuel switching; Mexico; household energy; cooking tests; LPG,

A long-term comparative end-use analysis for Cheranatzicurin village, Mexico",Energy for Sustainable Development,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2013.05.004,,"A detailed analysis of the change in the patterns of energy use in a Mexican village, from the year 1986 to 2012 is presented. The satisfaction of energy needs is analyzed according to the first- and second-law efficiencies of thermodynamics, for a total of 22 end-uses. The analysis covers both the end-use devices used for energy conversion and the energy and exergy used in the related thermodynamical tasks. The final energy per capita was 11.0 GJ/year in 2012, about 10% less than in 1986. In the study period, the overall first-law efficiency of the community increased from 17% to 23%, while the second-law efficiency rose from 6.4% to 8.2%. The increments in useful energy and minimum exergy (total and per capita), relative to 1986, occur at the expense of a small increase in the per capita consumption of final exergy of the community.

The rise of both energy efficiencies is a consequence of the reduction in fuelwood consumption and on the use of draft-animals, whose conversion efficiencies into final energies and useful work are extremely low. Also, there is 314% increase in the village's fossil fuel use, especially due to an increase in the penetration of gas and electric appliances into the household sector and of vehicles. The energy use in the productive sector including agriculture fell dramatically. CO2 emissions from the community's energy use rose by 279%.

Despite the increase of commercial energy use, and a rapid penetration of LPG cookstoves, fuelwood still represents 68% of the village final energy consumption. Also, there is a large mismatch between sources and needs in thermodynamic terms: while 72% of the energy needs correspond to work and heat at less than 100 °C, 99% of the energy sources imply combustion processes (fuelwood, LPG, gasoline and diesel) to mid and high temperatures. However, in order to reduce CO2 emissions, the electricity and transport devices have to increase their efficiencies, and primary energy ought to come in higher proportion from renewable sources.",17,5,463-470,,

Esta investigación se ejecutó en las parroquias de Seis de Julio de Cuellaje; Plaza Gutiérrez; Peñaherrera y Apuela, que se las agrupo como Zona 1; García Moreno y Vacas Galindo, como Zona 2; y como Zona 3, Imantag y Quiroga; las mismas que se las definió en base a sus características ecológicas, socioculturales, viales y tipo de cocina. Para evaluar el consumo de leña se aplicó una cobertura del 1 % de las unidades familiares o sea 56 unidades familiares (puntos de muestreo), distribuidos a través de una frecuencia relativa que se apoya en el número de familias por parroquia. La toma de datos se efectuó durante seis meses, una vez por semana a cada unidad familiar. Para obtener el volumen de consumo en estéreos se utilizó las dimensiones de altura, ancho y profundidad de la carga de leña. Fue necesario calcular los factores de conversión de volumen estéreo a volumen sólido; que se obtuvo midiendo cada uno de los palos que integraron la carga. Se determinó el volumen sólido, que dividido para el volumen estéreo permitió el calculo de los respectivos factores de conversión para las tres zonas. El volumen en metros cúbicos se transformó a toneladas métricas y por último a kilogramos. El resultado final fue kilogramos por persona y por día, ya que a nivel mundial este consumo se cuantifica en relación de peso y no de volumen. En cada carga se identificó las especies y luego se clasificó a nivel de género y cuando fue factible se determino la especie. Con fines de transformación de las unidades expresadas en volumen (m3) se transformo a peso (Toneladas métricas); consecuentemente fue necesario calcular el peso específico seco al horno. Con estos valores se determinó cuantos kilogramos consume cada unidad familiar (kg/per/día). Los resultados se proyectaron a un año calendario y luego se determinó la necesidad de formular una propuesta de plantaciones energéticas. Del estudio realizado se desprende que, las especies de mayor demanda para leña son: ARALIACEAE Oreopanax spp. Pumamaqui ASTERACEAE Baccharis spp. Chilca BIGNONACEAE Delastoma integrifolia Rose ex. Rudd Yaloman LAURACEAE Ocotea spp. Aguacate MIMOSACEAE Inga spp. Guabo MIMOSACEAE Calliandra pittieri Standl Tura MIRCINACEAE Rapanea spp. Tupial MYRTACEAE Eucalyptus globulus labill Eucalipto PIPERACEAE Piper spp Cordoncillo El consumo de leña por persona en estéreos, metros cúbicos y kilogramos por día y por año fueron los siguientes: CONSUMO Metros estereos/persona/año 2.61 m3/persona/año 1.23 kg/persona/día 2.064 kg/persona/año 753.31 Ton m/familia/año 2.944 La relación entre consumo de leña y gas es de 70% a 30% respectivamente. Los tipos de estufa que utilizan para cocinar son varilla, fogón y tres piedras, siendo la mas frecuente la de varilla. Para satisfacer los requerimientos de leña de manera continua en el Cantón Cotacachi se debe plantar en cercas vivas 55 Km/año con Eucaliptos grandis (Hill) Maiden y Alnus acuminata H.B.K.; y 50 Ha/año de masas puras con Eucaliptos globulus Labill, bajo un ciclo de rotación de cinco años logrando así una producción sostenida de 19 902.14 m3/año.",,,,LEÑA;PLANTACIONS ENERGETICAS;DIETAS ALIMENTICIAS;CONSUMO EN ESTEREOS,
